<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>Old Lady Lancaster had twenty thousand pounds a year
of her own. She had brought that much dower when she
came to her husband, the late Lord Lancaster, and now,
when he was dead, and she a childless widow, she was like
the Martha of Holy Writ&mdash;she was troubled over many
things.</p>

<p>The possession of great wealth usually entails trouble, it
is said, and Lady Lancaster's case was no exception to the
rule. The greatest anxiety she had was that she could not
decide what she would do with her fortune when she died.
She was eighty years old, and although she did not want
to die, she knew that she would have to do so some day,
and she wanted to make her will before that grewsome
event.</p>

<p>The title and estates of Lancaster had descended to the
late lord's nephew, young Clive Lancaster. It was but a
barren honor, after all, for there was no money to support
the dignity of the position. The deceased incumbent had
been a spendthrift, and so had his father before him.
They had dissipated all the property that was not strictly
entailed with the title, and the present heir had little to
live on except his pay as a captain in the army, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
still remained after his accession to the title, while at his
express wish and desire Lady Lancaster still reigned lady
paramount at his ancestral home, and kept up its wonted
dignity and state. She said she should leave all her
money to Captain Lancaster if he married to please her.
If not&mdash;and she shook her gray head ominously, not to say
viciously, at this point, and remained silent.</p>

<p>Lancaster Park was one of the loveliest places in Devonshire,
as Devonshire is one of the loveliest counties in
England. It seemed almost a pity that the young lord
could not afford to marry and bring home a beautiful
bride to grace his stately home. No one doubted but that
when the time came he would espouse the bride his aunt
selected for him. It would be folly, it would be madness,
if he refused. No one supposed that the handsome young
soldier could be capable of such rashness. He did not
dream of anything but obedience himself. He only hoped
that it would be a very pretty girl whom his aunt chose for
him, and also that the matrimonial hour was yet in the
dim distance. He was only five-and-twenty, and he did
not care to surrender his bachelor freedom yet. He was
amazed and confounded, therefore, when in a year after
his uncle's death Lady Lancaster sent him one of her
characteristic letters&mdash;short and to the point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Clive</span>"&mdash;she wrote&mdash;"try and get leave
to come down to Lancaster Park for a month or so this
fall. I have invited a lot of people for that time, among
them the girl I have chosen for you. Do not fail me.
Delays are dangerous."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>It was rather a command than a request, and the last
words sounded like a threat. The young lord-captain was
taken by storm. His heart sunk to the bottom of his tall
cavalry boots. He did not want to be married off-hand
like that. He secretly rebelled against a forced surrender
of his soldierly freedom, even though he gained twenty
thousand pounds a year in exchange for it. He took
counsel with his chum, young Harry De Vere, who was a
soldier, too.</p>

<p>"I'm ower young to marry yet," he said. "How
shall I outwit the old lady's designs upon me?"</p>

<p>"Come over to America with me," said Lieutenant De
Vere. "I have leave of absence for six months. You
can get it, too, by the asking. I am going over to the
States to spend my holiday. I should be delighted to have
you for a companion."</p>

<p>The idea took hold of Captain Lancaster's imagination
immediately.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," he said. "I have always intended
to make the tour of the United States, and if I do
not go before I am married, it is not likely I shall do so
afterward. I will write to my aunt to postpone her matrimonial
designs a little while longer."</p>

<p>He wrote to Lady Lancaster that he was very sorry indeed
to disappoint her, but that he had made a most positive
engagement to go over to the States next month with
his friend Harry De Vere, and now the young fellow would
not let him off, but as soon as they returned he should be
at her ladyship's command, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster was profoundly annoyed and chagrined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
at her nephew's letter. She did not want to postpone the
consummation of her favorite scheme. But she wisely
concluded to bear with the inevitable this time. She
wrote to the truant lord that she would excuse him this
once, but that he must be ready to fall in with her plans
next time, or it might be worse for him. Her fortune was
not likely to go a-begging for an owner.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>Captain Lancaster got leave and went off in triumph
with Lieutenant De Vere to the United States. When he
had put the ocean between himself and his match-making
relative, he breathed more freely.</p>

<p>"I can count on one year more of single blessedness
now, I hope," he said. "I do not suppose my aunt will
try to have me married off by a cablegram or a telephone
while I am absent."</p>

<p>De Vere laughed at his friend's self-congratulations.</p>

<p>"I never saw any one so unwilling to accept a fortune
before," he said.</p>

<p>"It is not the fortune I object to&mdash;it is the incumbrance
I must take with it," replied Captain Lancaster.</p>

<p>"Should a wife be regarded as an incumbrance?" inquired
the other, with a smile.</p>

<p>"That would depend upon whether she were one's own
choice or somebody else's. I can not imagine old Lady
Lancaster selecting an ideal wife for me."</p>

<p>"All the same you will accept the one she provides for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
you. It would be madness indeed to refuse," said his
friend.</p>

<p>"Well, well, we will not discuss it. May the evil day
be yet far off," responded Lancaster, fervently.</p>

<p>Woe unto him if her ladyship, far away under English
skies, could have heard his regrets, or have known that he
had taken his trip solely to stave off the evil day of his
marriage, as he so considered it. She was vexed over it.
While she deemed it an accident, she would have been
furiously angry could she have known it to have been design.
At home she was eating her heart out with impatience
and vexation, and eagerly counting the weeks and
months as they rolled away, thinking that each one brought
her nearer to his return and to the accomplishment of her
cherished scheme.</p>

<p>The months glided by, and at length the winter was
past and spring was at hand. It was April&mdash;that tender,
timid month, with its violets and daisies. Lady Lancaster's
heart beat more lightly. She had had a recent letter
from the traveler. He wrote that he would be at home by
the first of June. She began to lay her plans accordingly.
She would have a merry party at the Park to welcome him
home, and he should make up his mind then. There was
no time for delay.</p>

<p>She sent for the housekeeper to come to her immediately.
She wanted to make all her arrangements at once,
and she could do nothing without consulting Mrs. West,
the model housekeeper who had ruled at Lancaster Park
for sixteen years. My lady grew impatient while she sat
in her great velvet arm-chair and waited for the woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
coming. Her small black eyes snapped crossly, she
wriggled her lean, bent body in its stiff brocade, and the
bony little hands, with the great jeweled rings hanging
loosely upon them, grasped the jeweled serpent-head that
topped her walking-cane with nervous energy as she gasped
out, angrily: "Why don't the woman come? How dare
she keep me waiting?"</p>

<p>The door opened softly and Mrs. West entered just in
time to catch the impatient exclamation&mdash;a very lady-like
person indeed, in noiseless black silk, and a neat lace cap
that surrounded a face only half as old as that of the lady
of Lancaster Park.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that I kept you waiting, my lady,"
she said, quietly.</p>

<p>Then Lady Lancaster looked up and saw an open letter
in the housekeeper's hand, and the signs of inward disturbance
on her usually unruffled countenance.</p>

<p>"You know that I hate to be kept waiting, West," she
said, "and you are usually very prompt. But I see that
something has happened this time, so I am ready to excuse
your tardiness. What is it?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Lady Lancaster. Something <i>has</i> happened,"
said Mrs. West. She sunk down quietly, as she
spoke, into the chair that her mistress indicated by a nod
of her grim, unlovely head. "I have had a letter with
bad news in. I shall be obliged to quit your service."</p>

<p>"Quit my service!" echoed Lady Lancaster, wildly.
Her voice rose almost to a shriek, it was so full of dismay
and anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was what I said, my lady," reiterated the housekeeper,
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster regarded her in incredulous dismay a
moment, then she burst out, sharply:</p>

<p>"But I say you shall do no such thing; I can not spare
you, I can not get on without you at all&mdash;that is, not without
six months' warning to supply your place."</p>

<p>"A month is the usual time, Lady Lancaster," said the
housekeeper, mildly; and then, as the old lady regarded
her in speechless dismay, she added, quickly: "But I am
sorry that I can not even give you a month's warning to
supply my place, for I am obliged to leave you right away.
I have a long journey to take. I must cross the ocean."</p>

<p>"Cross the ocean! Now, did I ever! Are you crazy,
West?" demanded the old lady, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"I knew you would think so," said Mrs. West. "But
if you will be kind enough to let me explain the circumstances,
you mightn't think so hardly of me, Lady Lancaster."</p>

<p>"No circumstances could excuse your going off in this
way," flashed Lady Lancaster. "There is Lord Lancaster
coming home by the first of June, and of course I
must invite a party to meet him; and there are the rooms,
and&mdash;and&mdash;everything to be seen to. No one knows my
ways and my wishes like you who have been at Lancaster
Park so many years. Now, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>She lifted her wrinkled hands helplessly.</p>

<p>"There will have to be a new housekeeper found, of
course," hazarded Mrs. West, timidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; an ignorant creature who knows nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and who will have everything wrong, of course, just when I
want all to be at its best," groaned the wizened old aristocrat.
"I call this downright ungrateful in you, West,
this going off just as we had got used to each other's
ways."</p>

<p>Mrs. West suppressed a struggling smile around the corners
of her lips, and, rising up, stood respectfully before
her hard mistress.</p>

<p>"My lady, I'm sorry you think so hard of me. Indeed,
I would not leave you but for good cause," she said.
"I had hoped and expected to spend all my days at Lancaster
Park, but my duty calls me elsewhere. I assure
you it is as hard for me as for you. Think how hard it is
for me, a poor lone woman, to have to cross the ocean&mdash;at
my time of life, too! And then to have to take a child to
raise and spend all my earnings on&mdash;a child that's no kin
to me, either, you understand, my lady!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>Lady Lancaster settled her gold-bowed spectacles on
her long Roman nose, and fixed a keen, penetrating stare
on the troubled face of her housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Whose child is it, and what is it all about, anyhow?"
she sputtered, vaguely.</p>

<p>"It's my brother-in-law's child, and he's dead away off
in New York somewhere, and the child's left to me&mdash;his
penniless, friendless orphan child, left to me by the dead;
and how could I refuse the charge, my lady?" inquired
Mrs. West, reproachfully. "I should think the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
would come from his grave, away off yonder in America, to
haunt me if I didn't do his bidding," cried she, glancing
behind her with something like a shudder of superstitious
fear.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were simpleton enough to believe
in ghosts, West," sniffed my lady, contemptuously.
"And I didn't know you ever had a brother-in-law, either.
Where has he been all these years?"</p>

<p>"If you will read this letter, Lady Lancaster, you will
find out in fewer words than I can tell you," said Mrs.
West, respectfully presenting her letter, which all this
time she had been holding open in her hand.</p>

<p>My lady took the black-edged sheet into the grasp of her
thin, bony hand, and ran her keen eyes down the written
page.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sister-in-Law</span>"&mdash;it ran&mdash;"I know you've
wondered many a time since I caught the gold fever and
ran away to California, twenty years ago, what's become
of the willful lad that you and John couldn't manage;
although you tried so hard and so faithfully. I always
meant to write to you some day, but I put it off from time
to time in my hard, busy life, until now it's almost too
late, and I seem to be writing to you from the borders of
that other world where I've somehow heard my brother
John went before me, and where I'm hastening now. For
I'm dying, sister-in-law, and I'm quite sure that I shall be
dead before this comes to your hand. Well, I've had ups
and downs in this life, sister Lucy&mdash;good luck and ill luck&mdash;and
now I'm dying I have one great care upon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
mind. I'm leaving my little girl, my pretty Leonora&mdash;named
so for her mother, who died when her baby was
born&mdash;all alone in the cold, hard world. She is friendless,
for we've led such a roving life once she was born that we
have made no friends to aid us now in our extremity.
Dear sister-in-law, you were always a good woman. You
tried to do your duty by the wayward orphan boy who has
so poorly repaid your care. Will you be kinder still?
Will you come to America and take my child for your
own? Will you give her a mother's love and care? Remember,
she is friendless and forsaken in the world, without
a living relative. What would become of her if you
refused my dying prayer? I inclose a card with our New
York address upon it. She will wait there after I am dead
until you come for her. I feel sure that you will come;
you will not disregard my dying wish and request. Forgive
me all my ingratitude and thoughtlessness, sister
Lucy, and be a mother to my darling little Leo when I
am no more.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 5em;">"Your dying brother,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Richard West</span>."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter rustled in Lady Lancaster's nervous grasp.
She looked up thoughtfully at the patient, waiting woman.</p>

<p>"I could not refuse such a prayer as that, could I, my
lady?" she asked, wistfully. "You see, he was my husband's
only brother&mdash;poor, handsome, willful Dick. His
parents were both dead, and he had only me and John,
my husband. He was restless and ambitious. He ran
away and left a letter that he should go to California and
seek his fortune. From that day to this, never a word has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
been heard of Dick. And now he's dead&mdash;not so old,
either; only in the prime of life&mdash;and he's left me his
little girl. She will be a trouble, I know. I must give
up my quiet, peaceful home here and make a new home
for the child somewhere. But I can not refuse. I dare
not, for John's and Dick's sake. I must go to America
and get the child. I can not do less than he asked me.
He was always restless, poor Dick. He could not stay in
his grave if I refused his dying prayer."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>Lady Lancaster, filled with chagrin and despair, sat
gazing on the floor in silence. The thought of losing this
trusty, capable woman, who had belonged to the staff of
Lancaster Park so long, was most annoying to her. It had
come upon her with all the suddenness of a calamity. She
viewed it as nothing less.</p>

<p>She was an old woman, and she disliked exceedingly to
have new faces around her. Under Mrs. West's efficient
<i>régime</i> the affairs of the house had gone on with the precision
and regularity of clock-work. It would take a new
woman years to attain to her proficiency. She had grown
to regard the good housekeeper almost as her own property&mdash;a
piece of her personal goods and chattels. She
could not help being angry at the thought of losing
her.</p>

<p>"It is too bad," she blurted out, indignantly. "Why
do folks go and die like that, and leave their wretched
brats on other people's hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>A faint color crept into Mrs. West's comely face at the
scornful words.</p>

<p>"My lady, it's the will of God," she said, in her quiet,
deprecating way.</p>

<p>"I don't believe God has anything to do with it," cried
the old lady, violently. "If He did, He would prevent
poor folks from marrying, in the first place."</p>

<p>And then as she saw how patiently the woman endured
these taunts, she had the grace to be ashamed of herself.</p>

<p>"Well, there, there; I dare say you don't care to hear
your folks spoken of in that way," she said, in a milder
tone. "But then Richard West was no kin to you, anyway&mdash;only
your husband's brother!"</p>

<p>Mrs. West could not forbear a pertinent little retort.</p>

<p>"And Captain Lancaster is only your husband's
nephew, my lady, yet you take a great interest in him,"
she said.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster gave her a keen little glance.
"Humph! West has some spirit in her," she said to herself;
then, aloud, she replied:</p>

<p>"I can assure you the only interest I take in him is because
he is my Lord Lancaster; and as he holds the title
my late husband held, I should like for him to have money
enough to support it properly. But if he does not marry
to please me, you shall see how little I care for the young
popinjay."</p>

<p>Mrs. West made no reply, and her mistress continued,
after a moment's thought:</p>

<p>"Must you really take the child, do you think,
West?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I couldn't think of refusing poor Dick's dying request,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"Shall you make your home in America?" continued
the lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no; I should come back to dear old England.
I couldn't consent to pass my last days in a strange country."</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster was silent a moment. Her eyes were
very thoughtful; her thin lips worked nervously. Mrs.
West waited patiently, her plump hands folded together
over the letter that had brought her such strange, unwelcome
news. "Where are you going to live when the
child comes?" Lady Lancaster snapped, almost rudely.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet, my lady. I have made no plans.
I only received my letter a little while ago."</p>

<p>"You don't want <i>my</i> advice, I presume?"&mdash;more snappishly
than ever.</p>

<p>"I should be very glad of it," Mrs. West replied, respectfully.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ask it, then?"</p>

<p>"I didn't dare."</p>

<p>"Didn't dare, eh? Am I an ogress? Should I have
eaten you if you had asked my advice?" demanded the
irascible old lady, shortly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Lady Lancaster; but I shouldn't have presumed
to trouble you so far," Mrs. West replied, in her
quiet way that was so strange a contrast to the other's irritability.</p>

<p>"Very well. I've presumed to lay a plan for you," replied
the grim old lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"A plan for me!" Mrs. West echoed, vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes. You shall not go away from Lancaster Park.
You shall have the child here."</p>

<p>"Here!" cried the housekeeper, doubtful if she were in
her proper senses.</p>

<p>"Why, do you echo my words so stupidly, West?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I was doubtful if I understood
your words rightly. I thought you disliked children,"
Mrs. West answered, confusedly.</p>

<p>"I did, and <i>do</i>," tartly. "But, for all that, I had
sooner have Dick West's child here than for you to leave
me. You could keep her in your own rooms, couldn't
you? I needn't be bothered with her society?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," faltered Mrs. West, in a tremor of joy.
She was very glad that she was not to leave Lancaster
Park, where she had dwelt in peace and comfort for sixteen
years&mdash;ever since her faithful, hard-working John had
died and left her a lone widow with only fifteen pounds between
her and the world. She had thought herself a very
fortunate woman when she secured this place, and her
heart bounded with joy at the thought that she was to stay
on in peace, in spite of the incumbrance of her brother-in-law's
orphan child.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lady Lancaster, I don't know how to thank
you!" she cried. "I shall be very glad not to go away
from the Park. I will keep Leonora very close, indeed I
will, if you allow me to bring her here."</p>

<p>"Well, she shall be brought here. Of course I rely on
you to keep her out of my way. I dislike the ways of
children," said the hard old lady, who had never had any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
children herself, and who was an old maid at heart.
"That is all I ask of you. Don't have her around under
my feet, and I shall never remember that she is here."</p>

<p>"Thanks, my lady. And when am I to go and fetch my
niece?" inquired the housekeeper, timidly.</p>

<p>"You're not to fetch her at all. I thought I had told
you that already," tartly.</p>

<p>Mrs. West's eyes grew large and round with dismay.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I thought you said I should have her here,"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"So I did; I said she should be brought here, but I
didn't say you should go to New York and fetch her
home!"</p>

<p>"But Dick wished me to go," perplexedly; "and how
is she to come if I do not go?"</p>

<p>"She may come with Lord Lancaster the first of June.
I dare say he can go and get her all right."</p>

<p>"But it seems as if I ought to go myself. Besides,
Lord Lancaster mightn't like it, indeed," whimpered poor
Mrs. West.</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! I do not care whether he likes it or
not," declared the octogenarian, snapping her fingers.
"He shall do as I bid him. Aren't you willing to trust
the brat with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my lady," declared the housekeeper, with a
sigh of relief.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>"I'll be shot!" ejaculated Captain Lancaster, in a
voice of the liveliest exasperation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no; what have you done?" exclaimed his chum,
lifting his handsome head from his lounge amid a cloud of
curling, blue cigar-smoke.</p>

<p>"Nothing; I never did anything in my life," in an injured
tone, "and I am fain to ask why I am so bitterly
persecuted."</p>

<p>"Persecuted?" inquired De Vere, languidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can afford to be cool. You are the legal
heir to ten thousand a year. You are not at the beck and
call of a relative who gives you the most troublesome commissions
to execute without so much as saying 'by your
leave,'" growled Lancaster.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant laughed lazily.</p>

<p>"You have had a letter from my lady?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Look here, De Vere, I wonder if she thinks I
belong to her wholly? Must one be a white slave for the
sake of coming into twenty thousand a year?"</p>

<p>"It is worth lots of toadying," declared De Vere, emphatically.</p>

<p>"I used to like Aunt Lydia&mdash;rather&mdash;before my uncle
died," said Lancaster, reflectively. "She was always tart
and waspish. I didn't care for it when I didn't have
to bear the brunt of it. She rather amused me then,
but now I get out of patience with her whims and exactions."</p>

<p>"What is it she wants now?" asked Harry De Vere,
lazily.</p>

<p>"It is something I have to carry home to her from New
York. By Jove! I have a great mind to refuse. Anything
in reason I would willingly undertake; but, ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
really, this is too bad!" groaned the victim, dropping his
head back among the cushions of his chair.</p>

<p>It was a handsome head, crowned with short, crisp
masses of fair hair, and he was a blue-eyed young giant
with the perfect features of an Antinous, and a smile that
dazzled one when it played around the full red lips half
veiled by the drooping ends of the long, fair mustache.
He had an indolent air that was not unbecoming to him,
but rather taking than otherwise. He did not look like a
man who would overexert himself for anything, and yet
the air might have been cultivated and not natural.</p>

<p>"I did not know that there was anything on this side of
the 'herring-pond' her ladyship would deign to accept,"
said De Vere.</p>

<p>"There isn't. She has a horror of everything American."</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;what?" inquired the other, perplexedly,
and Captain Lancaster's moody brow cleared a moment,
and he laughed merrily at his friend's amazed air.</p>

<p>"Give it up, Harry. You couldn't guess in a month,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I give it up," resignedly.</p>

<p>"It's a female," said Lancaster, lifting his head to note
the effect on his inferior officer.</p>

<p>It was startling. The hands that were clasped behind
the lieutenant's head relaxed suddenly, and he sat bolt upright
on his sofa, his brown eyes distended to their greatest
size, his whole air indicative of the greatest astonishment.</p>

<p>"By George! You don't say so?" he ejaculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Lancaster relaxed from his perturbation to laugh at his
startled hearer. "It's astonishing what an effect the
mere mention of the female sex has upon you, De Vere,"
he observed.</p>

<p>"Well, you did take my breath away. I confess myself
astonished. Who is the female, Lancaster? Not," catching
his breath excitedly, "the chosen fair?&mdash;the fatal she
who is to out-captain the captain himself, and lead him
captive to the hymeneal altar?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" disgustedly, "how you run on! Of course
it is nothing of the sort. Could one come out of New
York that would please my august aunt?"</p>

<p>"'Can any good come out of Nazareth?'" quoted the
lieutenant, lightly. "But I say, Lancaster, you have excited
my curiosity to the highest pitch. Who is the
female? Am I to be associated with you in the care of
her?"</p>

<p>"I will hand over to you the whole charge, if you
wish," said the captain, with the same disgusted air.</p>

<p>"<i>Cela dépend.</i> Is she young and fair? I have found
New York girls rather fascinating, usually," said De
Vere, recalling sundry flirtations by the light of a chandelier,
with nobody very near.</p>

<p>"Young? yes&mdash;very young, I should say," growled
the captain, sardonically. "But not to keep you any
longer in suspense, listen to this portion of my dear
aunt's epistle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'There is a small commission I wish you to execute
for me, Clive. My housekeeper's brother has died in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
York and left her a little girl to take care of. I can not
spare Mrs. West long enough for her to go after the child;
and, in fact, I don't think it would be safe for her to go,
anyhow. She is so simple, poor woman, she would be
quite lost in the wilderness of New York, and might be
devoured by the bulls and bears that I hear infest the
place. So I want you to bring the child to England with
you. I dare say she will not be much trouble. I inclose
a card with her name and New York address. You are to
go there and get little Leo and bring her to her aunt.
Now, do not upon any account forget the child, Clive, for
West would be ready to die of chagrin if you did not bring
the little brat to her the first of June.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>He paused and looked at his friend in comical anger.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of anything so deucedly cool in
your life?" he said.</p>

<p>"No, I never did. It is most outrageous. What shall
you do?"</p>

<p>"Advise me, please. Shall I rebel against my tormentor's
mandate and refuse point-blank?"</p>

<p>"No, never. Rather meet the peril boldly and vanquish
it. Walk boldly up to the cannon's mouth. In
other words, accept the small commission."</p>

<p>"Small commission, indeed!" groaned the wretched victim.
"What shall I do with a child&mdash;a girl-child, too&mdash;perhaps
a baby?"</p>

<p>"That would be the best of all. You need have no
trouble then. Only provide a nurse, a sucking-bottle, and
some cans of condensed milk, put them aboard with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
baby, and all your trouble is over," suggested the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Is it so easy as that? Well, perhaps it is a baby. She
calls it a girl, a little child. Yes, I have no doubt it is a
baby. Well, when we leave Boston we will go over to
New York and see about the nurse and the bottles,"
sighed Lancaster.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>Captain Lancaster and his friend, having brought
letters of introduction from England, were having rather a
nice time in the cultured and æsthetic circles of Boston.
They had made the grand tour of the States, lingering at
the last in the beautiful city where they had made some
very pleasant acquaintances, and where, as eligibles of the
first water, they were fêted and courted in the most flattering
manner by the fashionable people of the place. It
is true that Lieutenant De Vere sometimes declared that
he found New York more charming, but still he lingered,
loath to go, and it was two weeks after the reception of
Lady Lancaster's letter before they turned their faces
toward the city that held the child that was to go to England
with them&mdash;the baby, as they had quite decided in
their own minds it must be.</p>

<p>There are a few people who, when they have a disagreeable
task to perform, go bravely forward and get it over.
There are a great many more who shirk such things and
put them off till the last moment. Captain Lancaster belonged
to the latter class. He was intensely afraid of disagreeables.
He revolted exceedingly from the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
"that squalling baby" he had to carry to England. He
thought that Mrs. West should come after it herself. Yet
Captain Lancaster was not a bad and selfish man, as one
might have supposed from his reluctance to do this kindness.
The whole gist of the matter lay in the fact that
his aunt had so cavalierly ordered him to do it. He chafed
beneath the plainly visible fact that she meant to lead him
by the nose as long as she lived, in virtue of the money she
was going to leave him when she died.</p>

<p>So our hero mentally kicked against taking home the
orphan child, and all unconsciously to himself directed a
part of his vexation at his aunt against the little one. The
mention of it was exceedingly distasteful to him, and when
Lieutenant De Vere once or twice represented to him that
he "ought to go and see about Leonora West before the
last day," he invariably replied: "My dear friend, it is
one of my rules never to do anything to-day that I can put
off until to-morrow."</p>

<p>So it was actually the day before they sailed when Lancaster
hunted up the address and went to look after his
charge, his "small commission," as Lady Lancaster had
blandly termed it. He went alone, for when De Vere
offered to accompany him he shook his head and replied,
decidedly, "No, I will not trouble you, for I can get over
disagreeable things best alone."</p>

<p>So he went alone, and the address took him to a quiet,
genteel boarding-house, in a quiet but highly respectable
street. He rang the bell impatiently, and a smart female
servant opened the door, smiling and bridling at the sight
of the big, handsome young aristocrat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have called to see about little Miss West. Is she
here?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lor', yes sir!" she replied. "Please to walk into
the parlor, and I'll take your card."</p>

<p>He handed her the small bit of pasteboard with his military
title, "Captain Lancaster," simply engraved upon it,
and said, abruptly:</p>

<p>"Send Miss West's nurse to me as soon as possible,
please. I am in a hurry. We must sail for England to-morrow."</p>

<p>She gazed at him a little stupidly. "The nurse!" she
echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes, the baby's nurse. Of course I must see her and
make arrangements for our voyage," he replied; and the
girl hastily retreated, and he caught the echo of a suppressed
titter outside the door.</p>

<p>"American rudeness and freedom," he said to himself,
disgustedly, as he walked up and down the limits of the
pretty little parlor with its Brussels carpet, lace curtains,
and open piano. "What did she see to giggle at, I wonder?"</p>

<p>And he glanced carelessly at his own elegant reflection
in the long, swinging mirror, and felt complacently that
there was nothing mirth-provoking there. From the top
of his fair, handsome head to the toe of his shining boot all
was elegant and irreproachable.</p>

<p>"Now, how long is that nurse going to make me wait?
I hope, upon my soul, she won't bring that horrid young
one in to display its perfections. I can well dispense with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the pleasure," he said to himself, grimly, and he then
turned hurriedly around at a sudden sound.</p>

<p>The door had opened softly, and a young girl, clad in
deep, lusterless mourning apparel, had entered the parlor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>Captain Lancaster was taken at a disadvantage. He
was not at all a vain man. He did not half know how
fine looking he was, and his hasty perusal of the mirror
was directed rather to his dress than his face. But as he
turned about hastily and met the half smile on the lips of
the new-comer, he realized instantly that his attitude had
favored strongly of masculine vanity, and a not unbecoming
flush mounted to his good-looking, straight-featured
face. He had a sneaking sense of shame in being caught
posing, as it were, before the mirror by this extremely
pretty girl.</p>

<p>She was more than pretty, this girl&mdash;she was rarely
beautiful. She was of medium height and size, and her
figure was symmetry itself, all its delicious curves and
slender outlines defined at their best by the close-fitting
black jersey waist she wore buttoned up to the graceful
white throat that had a trick of holding itself high, as if
innocently proud of the fair face that shone above it&mdash;the
face that Captain Lancaster gazed at in wonder for a moment,
and then in the most lively and decided disapprobation.</p>

<p>For she was much too pretty to be a nurse, he said to
himself&mdash;too pretty and too young. She had an air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
refinement quite above her position. She had an arch,
pretty face, with beautiful blue-gray eyes that were almost
black when the full white lids and dark lashes drooped
over them. The dazzling fairness of her complexion was
heightened by the unrelieved blackness of her dress, and
her pouting lips by contrast looked like rosebuds. Two
long, thick braids of lovely chestnut-brown hair hung
down her back, and some soft, fluffy rings of the same
color waved over the low, broad forehead with its slender,
dark brows. She was not only beautiful, she looked
bright and intelligent, and the half smile that parted her
red lips now made her wonderfully lovely.</p>

<p>But pretty as she was, she was aware that Captain Lancaster
was regarding her with knit brows and a general air
of entire disapprobation. Perhaps it was a novel experience.
It seemed to amuse her. The dimples deepened
around the sweet, arch mouth. She looked down at the
card in her hand, and began to read it aloud in a soft, hesitating,
inquiring voice: "Cap-tain Lan-caster?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, and was on the point of making his
most elegant bow when he suddenly remembered that it
was not at all necessary to be so ceremonious with the
nurse of his housekeeper's niece. So he straightened himself
up again and said, almost tartly:</p>

<p>"You are the baby's nurse, I presume?"</p>

<p>The long fringe of the girl's lashes lifted a moment, and
she flashed a dazzling glance into his face.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;baby?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the little Miss West&mdash;the child that is to get to
England under my care. Aren't you her nurse?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The young lady had put a very small, white hand up to
her face and coughed very hard for a moment. She
looked at him the next moment, very red in the face from
the exertion.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah, yes, certainly; I'm the nurse," she replied, demurely.</p>

<p>And then ensued a moment's silence, broken at last by
the girl, who said, quietly and politely:</p>

<p>"Won't you be seated, Captain Lancaster?"</p>

<p>He dropped mechanically into a chair near him, but the
pretty nurse-maid remained standing meekly in the center
of the room, her small hands folded before her, a demure
look on her fair face.</p>

<p>The caller cleared his throat and began, rather nervously:</p>

<p>"It isn't possible that you expected to go to England as
that child's nurse?" he said.</p>

<p>"I had hoped to do so," answered the girl, with a sudden
air of chagrin.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;ah&mdash;really, you know, you're too young, aren't
you?" stammered Lancaster, feeling abashed, he knew not
why, but maintaining a grave, judicial air.</p>

<p>"Too young? I should hope not. I was eighteen last
week," lifting the small head with an air of great dignity.</p>

<p>He could hardly repress a smile, but he put his long,
white hand hastily across his lips to hide it from those
bright, keen eyes.</p>

<p>"And do you think you can really take good care of
Miss West?" he said. "Remember, it is a long trip
across the ocean."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>She flashed him one of her swift, bright glances.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" she said. "But that does not matter at all,
sir. I consider myself quite competent to take care of
Miss West anywhere."</p>

<p>"Does she mean to be impertinent?" he thought; but a
glance at the demure, downcast face reassured him. It
was only the high self-confidence of ignorant, innocent
youth.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me; I don't know how they do such
things on this side of the water," he said, feeling mean
within himself, yet not at all understanding why it was so.
"But, you see, it is all different in England. There one
chooses a woman of age and experience for a nurse. Now,
I remember my own nurse was at least fifty years old."</p>

<p>"In-deed?" replied the girl, dropping him a demure
little courtesy that somehow again filled him with an uneasy
sense that, under all her pretty humility, she meant to
be impertinent. His face felt hot and burning. He did
not know how to pursue the conversation.</p>

<p>Seeing that he made her no answer, she looked up with
a pretty, appealing air. "Do I understand that you object
to taking me to England? that my youth counts
against me?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no; not at all, if you are sure you can take
good care of the baby," he replied, hastily. "You see, the
whole thing is a great bore and nuisance to me. I object
most decidedly to being encumbered with that child, but,
most unfortunately for me, I can't get out of it. So, if
you can really be of any use, pray go along with it to England&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The sudden exclamation was wrung from him by a
glance at her face. The pretty actress had dropped her
mask at hearing those swift, vehement words of his. A
hot color glowed in her face, two pearly tears started under
her dark lashes. She put out her white hands before her
as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Lancaster, say no more!" she cried.
"There has been some wretched mistake somewhere, and
I have only been laughing at you these five minutes. I am
nobody's nurse at all. There isn't any child nor any
baby. It is a grown-up young lady. I am Leonora
West."</p>

<p>Tableau!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>"If only the earth would open and swallow me up!"
sighed Lancaster to himself, miserably. It is not pleasant
to be made fun of, and the most of people are too thin-skinned
to relish a joke directed against themselves. Lancaster
did not. His ridiculous mistake flashed over him
instantly at the deprecatory words of the girl, and he
scarcely knew whom to be most angry with&mdash;himself or
Leonora West.</p>

<p>He stole a furtive glance at her, wishing in his heart
that he could subdue the crimson flush that glowed on his
face. He was glad that she was not looking at him. She
had sunk into a chair and buried her face in her hands.
Evidently she was not enjoying her saucy triumph much.
Those last impatient words of his had cleverly turned the
tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>He glanced at the drooping figure in the arm-chair, and
it flashed over him that De Vere would never be done
laughing if he knew that he, Lord Lancaster, a cavalry
officer, and a "swell party" altogether, had been made a
target for the amusement of this lowly born girl. How
dared she do it? and could he keep De Vere from finding
out? he asked himself in the same breath.</p>

<p>And just then Leonora West lifted her wet eyes to his
face, and said, with a sob in her throat:</p>

<p>"I am glad now that I didn't tell you the truth at first.
If I had, I mightn't have found out, perhaps, that you
thought me a bore and a nuisance, and that you didn't
want me to go to Europe with you."</p>

<p>Captain Lancaster winced. All she had said was quite
true, yet he had not cared to have her know it. It is but
seldom one cares to have people know one's real opinion of
them.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and"&mdash;she went on, resentfully, "you may be
quite, quite sure, after this, that I will not go with you.
You will have no trouble with me. My aunt might have
come after me herself, I think. I was afraid, when I got
her letter saying that you would come for me, that something
would go wrong. Now I know it. To think that
you should call me a baby!"</p>

<p>While she poured forth her grievances dolorously, Lancaster
had been collecting his wool-gathering wits. What
upon earth was he to do if she really refused to go with
him? He pictured to himself old Lady Lancaster's fury.
It was quite likely that, after such a contretemps, she would
cut him off with a shilling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will never do for her to stay in this mood. She shall
go to England, <i>nolens volens</i>," he resolved.</p>

<p>"Richard" began to be "himself again." The ludicrous
side of the case dawned upon him.</p>

<p>"I have made a tremendous <i>faux pas</i>, certainly, and
now I must get out of it the best way I can," he thought,
grimly.</p>

<p>Leonora's sharp little tongue had grown still now, and
her face was again hidden in her hands. He went up to
her and touched her black sleeve lightly.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," he said; "if you go on like this I
shall think I made a very apposite mistake. Who but a
baby would make such a declaration as yours in the face of
the circumstances? Of course you are going to Europe
with me!"</p>

<p>"I am not," she cried, with a mutinous pout of the rich
red lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are," he replied, coolly. "You have no
business to get angry with me because I made a slight mistake
about your age. And after all, I remember now that
it was really De Vere's mistake, and not mine."</p>

<p>"Who is De Vere?" inquired Leonora, curiously, as she
glanced up at him through her wet lashes, and showing
the rims of her eyes very pink indeed from the resentful
tears she had shed.</p>

<p>"De Vere is my friend and traveling-companion," he
replied.</p>

<p>"And does he, too, consider me a bore and a nuisance?"</p>

<p>"Well," confidingly, "to tell you the truth, we both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
did&mdash;that is, you know, while we were laboring under the
very natural mistake that you were a very small baby instead
of&mdash;a grown-up one. But all that is altered now, of
course, since I have met you, Miss West. We shall be only
too happy to have you for our <i>compagnon du voyage</i>."</p>

<p>He was speaking to her quite as if she were his equal,
and not the lowly born niece of the housekeeper at his ancestral
home. It was impossible to keep that fact in his
head. She was so fair, so refined, so well-bred, in spite of
the little flashes of spirit indicative of a spoiled child.</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he continued, pleasantly:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for the mistake on my part that
caused you so much annoyance. I desire to offer you every
possible apology for it."</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly. "Oh, I wasn't mad because
you thought Leonora West was a baby," she said.</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;because I thought you were a nurse?"</p>

<p>"Not that either. I was only amused at those mistakes
of yours."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, then added, with a rising flush:</p>

<p>"It was for those other words you said."</p>

<p>"I do not blame you at all. I was a regular brute,"
said Lancaster, penitently. "Do say that you forgive me,
I never should have said it if only I had known."</p>

<p>"Known what?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"That you were the baby I had to carry to England.
I should have been only too happy to be of service to you.
De Vere will be distracted with envy at my privilege.
There, I have said several pretty things to you. Will you
not forgive me now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I will forgive you, but you do not deserve it,"
answered Leonora. "It was not kind to talk about me so,
even if I had been an unconscious baby."</p>

<p>"It was not," he admitted. "But think a moment,
Miss West. I am a bachelor, and I know nothing at all of
babies. I have forgotten all the experiences of my own
babyhood. I was wretched at the idea of having to convey
one of those troublesome little problems across the ocean.
I would as soon have been presented with a white elephant.
I should have known quite as much of one as the other.
Can you find it in your heart to chide me for my reluctance?"</p>

<p>Leonora reflected, with her pretty brows drawn together.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you are right," she acknowledged, after
a moment. "They are troublesome&mdash;babies, I mean&mdash;I
think you called them problems. You were right there,
too, for one does not know what to make of them, nor
what they will do next, nor what they will become in
the future."</p>

<p>"Then you can not blame me, can not be angry with
me. And you will be ready to go with me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not. I am afraid, after all you have said,
Captain Lancaster, that you really are vexed in your mind
at the thought of taking me. I do not believe I ought to
take advantage of your pretended readiness," she replied,
sensitively, and with that perfect frankness that seemed to
be one of her characteristics.</p>

<p>"And you refuse to go with me?" He gazed at her despairingly.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," decidedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at the pretty face in some alarm. It had a
very resolute air. Would she really carry out her threat
of staying behind? He did not know much about American
girls, but he had heard that they managed their own
affairs rather more than their English sisters. This one
looked exceedingly like the heroine of that familiar ballad:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When she will, she will, depend on't,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And when she won't, she won't,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And there's an end on't."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She glanced up and saw him pulling at the ends of his
mustache with an injured air, and a dark frown on his
brow.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so mad? I should think you would
be glad I'm not going."</p>

<p>"I am vexed. I wasn't aware that I looked mad. In
England we put mad people into insane asylums," he replied,
rather stiffly.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I understand. Old England is giving
Young America a rhetorical hint. Why do you look so
vexed, then, Captain Lancaster?"</p>

<p>"Because there will be no end of a row in Lancaster
Park when I go there, because you have not come with
me."</p>

<p>"Will there, really?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and my aunt, Lady Lancaster, who has promised
to give me all her money when she dies, will cut me off
with a shilling because I have disobeyed her orders and disappointed
Mrs. West."</p>

<p>The blue-gray eyes opened to their widest extent.</p>

<p>"No!" she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then she must be a very hard woman," said Miss
West, in a decided tone.</p>

<p>"She is," he replied, laconically.</p>

<p>"You are certain that she would not give you the
money?" anxiously.</p>

<p>"Quite certain," he answered.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;have you none of your own?"</p>

<p>"Only my pay in the army," he admitted, laughing
within himself at her naïve curiosity.</p>

<p>"Is that much?" she went on, gravely.</p>

<p>"Enough to keep me in boots and hats," he answered,
with an owl-like gravity.</p>

<p>"And this Lady Lancaster&mdash;your aunt&mdash;does she give
you the rest?" persevered Leonora.</p>

<p>He did not want to be rude, but he burst out laughing.
She looked up into the bright blue eyes and reddened
warmly.</p>

<p>"I dare say you think me curious and ill-bred," she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, not at all. I am intensely flattered by
the interest you take in my affairs."</p>

<p>"It is only because I do not want to be the means of
your losing that money, if you want it. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do. Anybody would be glad to have twenty
thousand a year," he replied.</p>

<p>"So much as that? Then, of course, I must not be the
cause of your losing it," said Leonora, gravely.</p>

<p>"Then you will go with me?" he cried, with quite a
load lifted from his mind by her unexpected concession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye-es. I suppose I shall have to go," she answered.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks. I thought you would relent," he
said. "And will you be ready to sail with me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, quite ready. My trunks have been packed
several weeks, and I have been only waiting for you to
come," she answered, promptly.</p>

<p>And then she slipped her small hand into the folds of
her dress and drew out a netted silk purse, through whose
meshes he caught the glitter of gold pieces. She counted
out a number of shining coins into his hand with quite a
business-like air.</p>

<p>"That is the price of my ticket. Will you please buy
it for me? I will have my luggage sent down all right,"
she said.</p>

<p>He took the money mechanically and rose, thinking this
a dismissal. Then something that had been on his mind
all the time rose to his lips.</p>

<p>"I want to ask a great favor of you, Miss West."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a slight air of wonder, and
answered: "Yes."</p>

<p>"You will meet with my friend, Lieutenant De Vere,
on board the steamer. He is a very nice youth indeed.
He will be good friends with you directly."</p>

<p>"In-deed?" said Leonora, in a slow, inquiring voice
that implied a distinct doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. You need not look so incredulous.
You will be sure to like him. The ladies all adore him."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with the dimples coming into
roguish play around her mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you wish to warn me not to fall a victim to his
manifold perfections?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no, not at all. I never thought of such a
thing. You see, Miss West, my friend intensely enjoys a
joke."</p>

<p>"Yes?" she gazed at him with an air of thorough mystification.</p>

<p>"He intensely enjoys a joke," repeated Lancaster. "I
want you to promise me now, upon your honor, that you
will not tell him how unmercifully you quizzed me awhile
ago. He would never have done chaffing me if he knew,
and he would tell the whole regiment once we landed in
England."</p>

<p>"Would they tease you much?" inquired Leonora,
highly interested.</p>

<p>"Unbearably," he replied.</p>

<p>"They shall not know, then," she answered, promptly.
"I will not tell your friend about it."</p>

<p>"Nor any one?" he entreated.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she answered, soothingly, and involuntarily
he caught her hand and pressed it a moment in
his own, not displeased to see that she blushed as she drew
it hastily away.</p>

<p>He went away, and when he looked at his watch outside
the door he was honestly surprised.</p>

<p>"Two hours! I really do not know how the time
went," he said to himself.</p>

<p>When he went back to his hotel he found De Vere in a
state of surprise, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have been gone almost three hours," he said.
"Did you find the baby?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I found it," he replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Was it well? Shall we have the pleasure of its company
to-morrow?" pursued the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was well, but it is a spoiled child. I am afraid
we shall find it a source of trouble to us," replied Captain
Lancaster, smiling to himself at the surprise and delight
in store for De Vere to-morrow, when he should find that
it was a beautiful young girl instead of a cross baby who
was to be their <i>compagnon du voyage</i> to England.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>Lancaster electrified his friend next morning by informing
him that he must get their traps aboard the
steamer himself, as he would not have time to attend to
his own affairs, having some commissions to execute for
Miss West.</p>

<p>"The nursing-bottles and the cans of condensed milk,
you know," he said, with a mischievous laugh, and De
Vere stared.</p>

<p>"I should think the nurse would attend to that," he said.</p>

<p>"Nurses are forgetful, and I wish everything to be all
right, you know," replied his friend; "so I shall see to
everything myself."</p>

<p>"Well, you will have plenty of time to do so. We do
not sail until four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall have plenty to do in the meantime, so
you need not wait for me, Harry. You may just go aboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
at any time you like. I shall take a carriage and call for
the baby on my way down."</p>

<p>"You are getting very kind all at once," De Vere said,
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean to be. Having undertaken it, I mean to
see the poor little thing safely through."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you success," De Vere replied, as he
lighted a fresh cigar and turned away.</p>

<p>The tickets and state-rooms had already been secured,
and Lancaster hurried down-town, intent on securing all
the comforts possible for his fair charge, who had suddenly
grown very interesting in his eyes. He bought a steamer-chair,
some warm rugs, and a gayly colored Oriental wrap
that was both pretty and comfortable. Then he provided
himself with some nice novels and poems and books of
travel. When he had provided everything he could think
of that was conducive to a lady's comfort, he repaired to a
florist's and selected an elegant and costly bouquet.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that ladies always like a bunch of
flowers when they are traveling," he said to himself.
"But what will De Vere say to such reckless extravagance
on my part?"</p>

<p>He smiled to himself, thinking how the young lieutenant
would chaff.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I shall have got the start of him," he
thought. "He will be on the <i>qui vive</i> for a flirtation with
Leonora West."</p>

<p>Then he looked at his watch and found that he had consumed
so much time in making his purchases that he only
had time to take a carriage and call for his charge. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sent all his purchases to the steamer, and being encumbered
with nothing but the flowers, he made all haste to
execute his last and pleasantest task&mdash;accompanying Miss
West to the steamer on which they were to embark.</p>

<p>"Drive fast," he said to the man on the box; and when
they paused before the genteel boarding-house where he
had made Miss West's acquaintance the day before, he
jumped out with alacrity and ran up the steps.</p>

<p>The door was opened by the simpering maid of the day
before who had giggled at his ridiculous mistake. He
could not help coloring at the remembrance as he met her
recognizing smiles, a little tinctured with surprise.</p>

<p>He assumed an air of coldness and hauteur, thinking to
freeze her into propriety.</p>

<p>"I have called for Miss West to take her to the steamer.
Will you please see if she is ready?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lor', sir!" tittered the maid.</p>

<p>"I have called for Miss West," he repeated, more
sternly. "Can you inform me if she is ready?"</p>

<p>The maid bridled resentfully at his impatient air.</p>

<p>"Why, lawk a mercy, she was ready ages ago, mister!"
she said, tartly.</p>

<p>"Then ask her to come out, if you please. We have
barely half an hour to go on board," he said, glancing
hurriedly at his watch.</p>

<p>"I can't ask her. She is not here," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Not here? then where&mdash;" he began, but the pert maid
interrupted him:</p>

<p>"Lor', sir, Miss West went down to the steamer two
hours ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>An audible titter accompanied the information.</p>

<p>Lancaster bounded down the steps without a word,
sprung into his carriage, and slammed the door with a
vim.</p>

<p>"Drive down to the steamer just as fast as you can,
coachman!" he hallooed, sharply.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>De Vere stared in wonder when his friend scrambled
up the plank alone with his beautiful bouquet. He was
not a minute too soon, for in an instant the gang-plank was
hauled in, and they were outward bound on the dark-blue
sea.</p>

<p>"Halloo!" shouted the lieutenant, sauntering up;
"where's the precious babe?"</p>

<p>His air of unfeigned surprise was most exasperating to
Lancaster in his disappointed mood. He was about to exclaim,
"Hang the babe!" but recollected himself just in
time to glance around at the passengers on deck. No, she
was not there, the pretty American maid who was so gracefully
independent. "Gone to her state-room, probably,"
he thought, with profound chagrin, and leaning over the
railing, pitched his fragrant exotics impulsively into the
sea.</p>

<p>"So much for my foolish gallantry to Mrs. West's
niece," he said to himself, hotly.</p>

<p>Raising his eyes then, he met De Vere's stare of wonder.</p>

<p>"Have you gone clean daft, my dear captain?" inquired
he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know why you should think so," said Lancaster,
nettled.</p>

<p>"From your looks, man. You come flying up the
gang-way, breathless, and when I ask you a question you
stare around distractedly, and run to the railing to pitch
over one of the sweetest bouquets I ever laid eyes on.
Now, what am I to think of you, really?"</p>

<p>He laughed, and Lancaster, trampling his vexation
under-foot, laughed too. He was vexed with himself that
he had let Leonora West put him out so.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for my rudeness," he said. "I
will explain. You see, I was so busy all day that I only
had time at the last to jump into a carriage and call for
Miss West. Then I was detained by an impertinent servant
who, after ten minutes of stupid jargon, told me that
my charge had gone down to the steamer two hours before.
So then we had not a minute to spare, and of course I was
flurried when I came aboard."</p>

<p>"But the bouquet?" suggested De Vere, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I bought that for my charge," replied Lancaster,
airily.</p>

<p>"Rank extravagance! And didn't you know more
about the tastes of babies than that, my dear fellow? A
rattle would have been a more appropriate and pleasing
selection. You know what the poet says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Pleased with a rattle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tickled with a straw.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, I remembered that just as I came aboard, and I
was so vexed at my foolish bouquet that I tossed it overboard,"
Lancaster replied, with the utmost coolness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat down, lighted a weed, and leaning over the rail,
watched the deep, white furrows cut in the heaving sea by
the bounding ship. His thoughts reverted provokingly to
Leonora West.</p>

<p>"What is she doing? Will she come on deck this evening?
Did she think I would not call for her, or did she
come down first with malice prepense?" he asked himself,
one question after another revolving busily through his
brain.</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Vere's gay voice jarred suddenly on his
musings:</p>

<p>"Tell you what, old fellow, you missed something by
not coming aboard with me. I formed a charming acquaintance
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Eh, what?"&mdash;the captain roused himself with a start.</p>

<p>"I formed a charming acquaintance on board ship this
afternoon. Prettiest girl in America&mdash;England, either, I
should say."</p>

<p>A swift suspicion darted into Lancaster's mind.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed?" he said. "What is the divinity's
name?"</p>

<p>"I have not found out yet," confessed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Ah! then your boasted acquaintance did not progress
very far," chaffingly.</p>

<p>"No; but I rely on time to develop it. We shall be on
board steamer ten days together. I shall certainly find
out my fair unknown in all that time," confidently.</p>

<p>Lancaster frowned slightly with that lurking suspicion
yet in his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't look so indifferent!" cried De Vere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would have lost your head over her, too, old man.
Such a face, such a voice, such an enchanting glance from
the sweetest eyes ever seen!"</p>

<p>"And such a goddess deigned to speak to you?" sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yes. Shall I tell you all about it? I'm dying to talk
to some one about her!"</p>

<p>"Don't die, then. I would rather be bored with your
story than have to carry your corpse home to the regiment."</p>

<p>"It was this way, then: I was <i>ennuyé</i> at the hotel, so I
came on board early with my traps&mdash;as early as one
o'clock. It was about two, I think, when she came&mdash;lady
and gentleman with her."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and shawls&mdash;bags, books, bouquets&mdash;the three
B's&mdash;<i>ad infinitum</i>. She had a dark veil over her face.
Her friends bade her good-bye&mdash;lady kissed her with enthusiasm&mdash;then
they gave her the shawls and three B's
they had helped carry, and went away."</p>

<p>"Who went away?"</p>

<p>"The lady and gentleman went away. If you had been
listening half-way to my story, Lancaster, you would have
understood what I said."</p>

<p>"Don't be offended. I am giving you my strictest
attention. Go on, please."</p>

<p>"She gathered all her things in her arms&mdash;she should
have had a maid, really&mdash;and began to trip across the
deck. Then the wind&mdash;bless its viewless fingers whirled
off her veil and tossed it in the air."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fortunate!" muttered Lancaster.</p>

<p>"Yes, wasn't it?" cried De Vere, in a lively tone. "So
I gave chase to the bit of gossamer and captured it just as
it was sailing skyward. I carried it back to her, and lo! a
face&mdash;well, wait until you see her, that's all."</p>

<p>"Is that the end of the story?" queried Lancaster, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Well, it was the sweetest face in the world.
A real pink and white; eyes that were gray, but looked
black because the lashes were so long and shady. Pouting
lips, waving bangs, just the loveliest shade of chestnut.
Imagine what I felt when this lovely girl thanked me in a
voice as sweet as a sugar-plum, and gave me her things to
hold while she tied on her veil again."</p>

<p>"I hope you did not let her see how moonstruck you
were on the instant."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm afraid she did," dubiously.
"You see, I was so taken by surprise I had not my wits
about me. I talked to her quite idiotically&mdash;told her I
would not have restored the veil had I known she would
hide that face with it again."</p>

<p>"And she?" asked Lancaster, with a restless movement.</p>

<p>"Oh, she colored and looked quite vexed a moment.
Then she asked me, quite coolly, if my keeper was on
board."</p>

<p>There was a minute's silence. Lancaster's broad shoulders
shook with suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>"So I begged a thousand pardons," De Vere continued,
after a minute's thoughtful rumination, "and I found
her a seat and brought the chamber-maid to take her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
things and show her her state-room; so she could not
choose but forgive me, and I talked to her a minute."</p>

<p>"And told her all about yourself in a breath," laughed
the captain.</p>

<p>"No; I would have done it, but she did not stop long
enough to hear me. I asked her if she was going to cross
the 'big pond' all alone by herself, as Pat would say, and
she laughed very much and said no; she was to have two
chaperons. Then she asked me was I going, too. I said
yes, and was fumbling for my card-case when the chamber-maid
whisked her away from me. But to-morrow I shall&mdash;Oh,
oh! Lancaster," in a suppressed tone of ecstasy,
"there she is now!"</p>

<p>Lancaster dropped his cigar into the heaving waves and
turned his head. He saw a lissom, graceful figure coming
unsteadily across the heaving deck&mdash;Leonora West!</p>

<p>Leonora West, even more fair and bonny looking than
yesterday, in a jersey waist and a black-kilted skirt just
short enough to show the arched instep of an exquisite
foot in a dainty buttoned boot. She carried her veil on
her arm now, and wore a big black hat on her head, under
which all her wealth of curling chestnut hair waved loosely
to her perfect waist. The fair "innocent-arch" face
looked as fresh as a rose and beamed with gentleness and
good nature.</p>

<p>Captain Lancaster rose up deliberately, and disregarding
his friend's amazement, went forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"Miss West, the deck is rather unsteady. Will you
honor me by taking my arm?" he said, bowing before her
with elaborate politeness.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>Lieutenant De Vere gazed in the most unfeigned
astonishment, not to say dismay, at the strange and unexpected
sight of Captain Lancaster coolly leading the unknown
beauty across the unsteady deck. As he said of
himself when relating it afterward, he might have been
"knocked down with a feather."</p>

<p>And when he saw that they were coming straight toward
him, and that Lancaster had quite an air of proprietorship,
and that the girl was looking up with an arch smile at
him, he was more astonished than ever, he was almost
stupefied with amazement. Did Lancaster know her,
really? And why had he kept it to himself, selfish fellow?</p>

<p>And then he was overpoweringly conscious that they had
come up to him. He struggled to his feet and came near
falling back over the railing into the ocean, out of sheer
wrath, for just then Captain Lancaster said, with just a
touch of raillery in his tone:</p>

<p>"Miss West, permit me to present my friend, Lieutenant
De Vere."</p>

<p>"Lancaster knew her all the while, and he has been
chaffing me all this time," flashed angrily through De
Vere's mind but he suppressed his rising chagrin and said,
with his most elaborate bow:</p>

<p>"I am most happy to know your name, Miss West. I
have been longing to know it ever since I met you this
afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"What audacity!" thought Lancaster to himself, with
a frown that only grew darker as the girl replied, gayly:</p>

<p>"And I am very glad to know that you are Captain
Lancaster's friend. You will help to amuse me on the
way over."</p>

<p>She sat down between them, Lancaster on one hand, De
Vere on the other. The lieutenant looked across the
bright, sparkling young face at his friend.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that this is <i>the</i> baby?" pointedly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But, how&mdash;" pausing helplessly.</p>

<p>Lancaster laughed, and Leonora joined her musical
treble to his.</p>

<p>"You see, De Vere, there was a mistake all around,"
he said. "I found out yesterday that the baby existed
only in our imaginations."</p>

<p>"You might have told me," De Vere muttered, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I was reserving a pleasant surprise for you to-day,"
Lancaster rejoined.</p>

<p>Leonora turned her bright eyes up to his face.</p>

<p>"When did you come aboard?" she inquired, naïvely.</p>

<p>"At the last moment," he replied, rather coldly.</p>

<p>"You were detained?"</p>

<p>"Yes," dryly.</p>

<p>A sudden light broke over De Vere's mind. He laughed
provokingly.</p>

<p>"Miss West, would you like to know what detained
him?" he inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"He went up to Blank Street, to fetch you," laughing.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Ask him, if you doubt me."</p>

<p>She looked around at Lancaster. There was a flush on
his face, a frown between his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You did not, really, did you?" she asked, naïvely.</p>

<p>"I did," curtly.</p>

<p>"Don't tease him about it. He was furiously angry
because you ran away and came by yourself," said De
Vere. He was beginning to turn the tables on Lancaster
now, and he enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>"But I did not come by myself. My friends where I
boarded&mdash;Mrs. Norton and her husband&mdash;came with me.
I did not know Captain Lancaster was coming for me. If
I had known I should have waited," apologetically.</p>

<p>"You do not know what you missed by not waiting,"
said De Vere. "When Lancaster came aboard he had a
great big hot-house bouquet."</p>

<p>"And I do so love flowers," said Leonora, looking
round expectantly at the captain.</p>

<p>"Ah, you needn't look round at him now. It is too
late," said De Vere, wickedly. "When he came scrambling
up the gang-plank, at the last moment, and didn't
see you anywhere on deck, he was so overcome by his disappointment,
to use the mildest phrase, that he threw the
beautiful bouquet out into the sea."</p>

<p>"Ah! you did not, really, did you, Captain Lancaster?"
exclaimed Leonora, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Yes; the flowers were beginning to droop," he replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>,
fibbing unblushingly; and then he arose and walked away
from them, too much exasperated at De Vere's chaff to
endure his proximity a minute longer.</p>

<p>He crossed over to the other side of the deck and stood
there with his face turned from them, gazing out at the
beautiful, foam-capped billows of old ocean with the golden
track of the sunset shining far across the waves. There
came to him suddenly the remembrance that he was homeward
bound.</p>

<p>He was homeward bound. In a few days, or weeks at
most, he should be at home; he should be at Lancaster
Park; he should meet the girl his vixenish aunt had chosen
for his future bride. He wondered vaguely what she
would be like&mdash;pretty, he hoped; as pretty as&mdash;yes, as
pretty as&mdash;Leonora West.</p>

<p>Her clear, sweet voice floated across the deck, the words
plainly audible.</p>

<p>"You are both soldiers. How pleasant! I do so adore
soldiers."</p>

<p>"You make me very happy, Miss West," cried De Vere,
sentimentally, with his hand upon his heart.</p>

<p>"But not," continued Leonora, with a careless glance
at him, "not in their ordinary clothes, you understand,
Lieutenant De Vere. It is the uniform that delights me.
I think it is just too lovely for anything."</p>

<p>De Vere, crushed to the earth for a moment, hastily
rallied himself.</p>

<p>"I would give the half of my kingdom," he said, "if
only I had gone traveling in my red coat."</p>

<p>"I wish you had," she replied. "But some day&mdash;after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
we get to England, I mean&mdash;you will let me see you in it,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Every day, if you like. I shall only be too happy,"
vivaciously.</p>

<p>"I'll be shot if you shall have an invitation to Lancaster
Park, you popinjay!" Lancaster muttered to himself, in
unreasonable irritation.</p>

<p>He moved away a little further from them, out of earshot
of their talk, but he could not as easily divert his
thoughts from them.</p>

<p>"How silly people can be upon occasion!" he thought.
"How dare he get up a flirtation with Mrs. West's niece?
She is wholly out of his sphere. Once she gets to England,
I dare swear he will never be permitted to lay eyes
on her again. He shall not make a fool of the child. She
is but a child, and ignorant of those laws of caste that will
trammel Mrs. West's niece in England. I will speak to
him."</p>

<p>That night when the girl had gone to her state-room,
and the two men were alone on deck smoking their cigars
in the soft spring moonlight, Lancaster said, rather diffidently:</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, De Vere, weren't you going the pace rather
strong this evening?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I say you oughtn't to try to flirt with little Leonora
West. You were saying no end of soft things to her this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
evening. It isn't right. She's in my care, and I can't see
her harmed without a word."</p>

<p>"Harmed? Why, what the deuce are you hinting at,
Lancaster?" his friend demanded, hotly.</p>

<p>"Nothing to make you fly into a temper, Harry," Lancaster
answered, gravely. "Nothing but what is done every
day by idle, rich men&mdash;winning an innocent, fresh young
heart in a careless flirtation, and then leaving it to break."</p>

<p>De Vere dropped his fine Havana into the waves and
looked around.</p>

<p>"Look here, Lancaster," he said, "tell me one thing.
Do you want Miss West for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," haughtily, with a hot flush
mounting to his brow.</p>

<p>"I mean you are warning me off because you're in love
with the little thing yourself? Do you want to win her&mdash;to
make her my lady?"</p>

<p>"What then?" inquired Lancaster, moodily.</p>

<p>"Why, then, I only want an equal chance with you,
that's all&mdash;a fair field and no favor."</p>

<p>They gazed at each other in silence a moment. Lancaster
said then, with something like surprise:</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Never more so in my life."</p>

<p>"Have you remembered that your family will consider
it a <i>mésalliance</i>?"</p>

<p>"I am independent of my family. I have ten thousand
a year of my own, and am the heir to a baronetcy."</p>

<p>"But you are rash, De Vere. You never saw Leonora
West until to-day. What do you know of her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that she is the fairest, most fascinating creature
I ever met, and that she has carried my heart by
storm. I know that if she is to be won by mortal man,
that man shall be Harry De Vere!" cried the young
soldier, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>There was silence again. The great ship rose and fell
with the heaving of the waves, and it seemed to Lancaster
that its labored efforts were like the throbbing of a heart
in pain. What was the matter with him? He shook off
angrily the trance that held him.</p>

<p>"Since you mean so well, I wish you success," he said.</p>

<p>"Thanks, old fellow. I thought at first&mdash;" said De
Vere, then paused.</p>

<p>"Thought&mdash;what?" impatiently.</p>

<p>"That you were&mdash;jealous, that you wanted her for
yourself."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! My future is already cut and dried," bitterly.</p>

<p>"A promising one, too: twenty thousand a year, a wife
already picked out for you&mdash;high-born and beautiful, of
course. Even Lady Lancaster couldn't have the impertinence
to select any other for Lord Lancaster."</p>

<p>"Oh, by the bye," Lancaster said, with sudden eagerness.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Do me this favor: don't rehearse any of my family
history to Miss West&mdash;the barren title, the picked-out
bride, and&mdash;the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. But of course she will know once she
gets to England."</p>

<p>"At least she need not know sooner," Lancaster replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," assented De Vere; and then he asked thoughtfully.
"Is it true that her aunt is the housekeeper at
Lancaster Park?"</p>

<p>"That is what my aunt says in her letter."</p>

<p>"And yet she&mdash;my little beauty&mdash;does not look lowly
born."</p>

<p>"No; her mother was an American, you know. They&mdash;the
Americans&mdash;all claim to be nobly born, I believe.
They recognize no such caste distinctions as we do. Miss
West bears a patent of nobility in her face," said Lancaster,
kindly.</p>

<p>"Does she not, the little darling? What a sweet good
nature beams in her little face. And, after all, it is our
own poet laureate who says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Howe'er it be, it seems to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Tis only noble to be good:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kind hearts are more than coronets,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And simple faith than Norman blood.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yet I think you will find it hard to bring the rest of
the De Veres to subscribe to Tennyson's verse," Lancaster
said, anxiously.</p>

<p>"They will e'en have to. I shall please myself, if I can&mdash;mark
that, lad. So you needn't scold any more, old
fellow, for I am in dead earnest to make Leonora Mrs. H.
De Vere," laughed the young soldier.</p>

<p>"You are the arbiter of your own destiny. Enviable
fellow!" grumbled Lancaster.</p>

<p>"I never knew what a lucky fellow I was until now,"
agreed De Vere. "It was fortunate for me that I had a
bachelor uncle in trade, and he left me his fortune when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
he died. I can snap my fingers at my family if they cut
up about my choice."</p>

<p>"Yes," Lancaster said, dryly.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are just thinking to yourself what a dude I
am!" exclaimed De Vere, suddenly. "Here I am talking
so confidentially about my choice, when I do not even know
if she will look at me. What do you think about it, eh?
Do I stand any chance with her?"</p>

<p>"If she were a society girl, I should say that you stood
no chance of being refused. No girl who had been properly
educated by Madame Fashion would say no to ten
thousand a year and a title in prospective," Lancaster replied,
with conviction.</p>

<p>"You are putting my personal attractions quite out of
the question," said De Vere, chagrined.</p>

<p>"Because they are quite secondary to your more solid
recommendations," sarcastically.</p>

<p>"And, after all, you have not said what you think about
my chances with Miss West."</p>

<p>"I do not know what to say, because I do not at all understand
her. Yet if she is poor, as of course she must
be, and being lowly born, as we know, she could not do
better than take you, if she is worldly wise."</p>

<p>"You talk about my worldly advantages very cynically,
Lancaster. Do you not think that I might be loved for
myself?" inquired De Vere, pulling at his dark mustache
vexedly, and wondering if he (Lancaster) believed himself
to be the only handsome man in the world.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course. You're not bad looking. You
have the smallest foot in the regiment, they say, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
whitest hand, and your mustache is superb," Lancaster
replied, laughing, for from his superb size and manly
beauty he rather despised small dandies; and De Vere, feeling
snubbed, he scarcely knew why, retired within himself
after the dignified reply:</p>

<p>"I humbly thank you, Captain Lancaster; but I was
not fishing for such weak compliments."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>Miss West accepted the steamer-chair, the rugs, the
wraps, and the books with unfeigned pleasure, and buried
herself in the volumes with a pertinacity that was discouraging
to her ardent wooer. She wearied of the blue
sky and the blue ocean, the everlasting roll of the ship,
the faces of her fellow-voyagers, of everything, as she
averred, but the books. They had a fair and prosperous
journey, and every sunny day Leonora might be seen on
deck, but whether walking or sitting, she had always a
book in her hand in whose pages she persistently buried
herself at the approach of any one with whom she was disinclined
to talk. In this discouraging state of things De
Vere's wooing sped but slowly, and Lancaster's acquaintanceship
progressed no further than a ceremonious "Good-morning,"
"Good-evening," "Can I be of any service
to you?" and similar stilted salutations, to all of which
Leonora replied with a quietness and constraint that put a
check on further conversation. No one could complain
that she gave any trouble; she was quiet, courteous, and
gentle, and there were two pairs of eyes that followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
demure, black-robed figure everywhere upon the deck, and
the owners of the eyes wished, perhaps, that she would call
on them for more attention, more services, so oblivious did
she seem of the fact that they waited assiduously upon her
lightest command.</p>

<p>"She is not a little flirt, as I thought at first, seeing her
with De Vere," the captain said to himself. "She is a
clever little girl who is better pleased with the thoughts of
clever writers than the society of two great, trifling fellows
such as De Vere and myself. I applaud her taste."</p>

<p>All the same, he would have been pleased if the pretty
face had lighted sometimes at his coming, if she had seemed
to care for talking to him, if she had even asked him any
questions about where she was going. But she did not
manifest any curiosity on the subject. She was a constrained,
chilly little companion always to him. It chagrined
him to see that she was more at her ease with De
Vere than with him. Once or twice she unbent from her
lofty height with the lieutenant, smiled, chatted, even
sang to him by moonlight, one night, in a voice as sweet
as her face. But she was very shy, very quiet with the
man whose business it was to convey her to England. She
tried faithfully to be as little of "a bore and nuisance" as
possible.</p>

<p>It did not matter; indeed, it was much better so, he told
himself, and yet he chafed sometimes under her peculiar
manner. He did not like to be treated wholly with indifference,
did not like to be entirely ignored, as if she had
forgotten him completely.</p>

<p>So one day when De Vere lolled in his state-room, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
went and stood behind her chair where she sat reading.
It was one of the poets of his own land whose book she
held in her hand, and the fact emboldened him to say:</p>

<p>"You like English authors, Miss West. Do you think
you shall like England?"</p>

<p>She lifted the blue-gray eyes calmly to his face.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, concisely.</p>

<p>He flushed a little. It was his own native land. He
did not like to hear her say she should not like it.</p>

<p>"That is a pity, since you are going to make your home
there," he said.</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure of that," she answered, putting
her white forefinger between the pages of her book, and
turning squarely round to look at him as he talked.
"Perhaps if I can not bring myself to like England, I
may persuade my aunt to come to America with me."</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster would die of chagrin if you did," he
replied, hastily.</p>

<p>He saw a blush color the smooth cheek, and wished that
he had thought before he spoke.</p>

<p>"She is poor and proud. She does not like to be reminded
that her aunt is a servant at Lancaster Park," he
said, pityingly, to himself.</p>

<p>And he recalled De Vere's intentions with a sensation of
generous pleasure. Leonora, with her fair face and her
cultured mind, would be lifted by her marriage into the
sphere where she rightly belonged. Then she would like
England better.</p>

<p>"I have been reading your poet laureate," she said. "I
was much struck by these lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Howe'er it be, it seems to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">'Tis only noble to be good:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Kind hearts are more than coronets,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And simple faith than Norman blood.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I should not have thought an English poet would write
that," she went on. "I thought England was too entirely
governed by the laws of caste for one of her people
to give free utterance to such a dangerous sentiment."</p>

<p>"You must not judge us too hardly," he said, hastily.</p>

<p>Ignoring his feeble protest, she continued: "My papa
was English, but he was not of what you call gentle birth,
Captain Lancaster. He was the son of a most unlucky
tradesman who died and left him nothing but his blessing.
So papa ran away to America at barely twenty-one. He
went to California to seek his fortune, and he had some
good luck and some bad. When he had been there a year
he found a gold nugget that was quite a fortune to him.
So he married then, and when I was born my pretty young
mamma died. After that he lived only for me. We had
many ups and downs&mdash;all miners have&mdash;sometimes we
were quite rich, sometimes very poor. But I have been
what you call well educated. I know Latin and French
and German, and I have studied music. In America, I
can move in quite good society, but in your country&mdash;"
she paused and fixed her clear, grave eyes on his face.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"In England," she said, "I shall, doubtless, be relegated
to the same position in society as my aunt, the
housekeeper at Lancaster Park. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>He was obliged to confess that it was true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then is it likely I shall love England?" she said.
"No; I am quite too American for that. Oh, I dare say
you are disgusted at me, Captain Lancaster. You are
proud of your descent from a long line of proud ancestry."
She looked down at her book and read on, aloud:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I know you're proud to bear your name,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Your pride is yet no mate for mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Too proud to care from whence I came.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He knew the verse by heart. Some impulse stronger
than his will or reason prompted him to repeat the last
two lines, meaningly, gazing straight into the sparkling,
dark-gray eyes with his proud, blue ones:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A simple maiden in her flower<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is worth a hundred coats of arms.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The gray eyes, brave as they were, could not bear the
meaning gaze of the blue ones. They wavered and fell.
The long lashes drooped against the cheeks that flushed
rosy red. She shut up the book with an impatient sigh,
and said, with an effort at self-possession:</p>

<p>"You shall see that I will bring my aunt home to
America with me, Captain Lancaster."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; and yet I think she loves England&mdash;as
much, I dare say, as you do America."</p>

<p>"I hope not, for what should we do in that case? I
have only her, she has only me, and why should we live
apart?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you have left behind you
no relatives?" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I told you I had no one but Aunt West," she said,
almost curtly.</p>

<p>"And she can scarcely be called your relative. I believe
she was only your father's sister-in-law," he said.</p>

<p>"That is true," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then why go to her at all, since the kinship is but in
name, and you would be happier in America?" he asked,
with something of curiosity.</p>

<p>"Papa wished it," she replied, simply.</p>

<p>Then there was a brief silence. Leonora's lashes
drooped, with the dew of unshed tears on them. The
young face looked very sad in the soft evening light.</p>

<p>"She is almost alone in the world&mdash;poor child!" he
thought.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you something," he said, impulsively.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, listlessly.</p>

<p>"Was it because of those things we talked of just now&mdash;those
aristocratic prejudices&mdash;that you have so severely
ignored De Vere and me?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," she replied, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Then, why?" he asked, gravely.</p>

<p>She looked up into the handsome blue eyes. They were
regarding her very kindly. Something like a sob swelled
her throat, but she said, as calmly as she could:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the reason, Captain Lancaster. Do you
remember the day we sailed, and what you and Lieutenant
De Vere talked of that night over your cigars?"</p>

<p>"I remember," he replied, with an embarrassment it
was impossible to hide.</p>

<p>The clear eyes looked up straight into his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, "I heard every word you said
to each other there in the moonlight."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>For the second time since he had met Leonora West,
Captain Lancaster devoutly wished that the earth would
open and hide him from the sight of those gray-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I heard every word," she repeated, and his memory
flew back anxiously to that night.</p>

<p>"Oh, impossible!" he cried. "You had retired. We
were alone."</p>

<p>The fair cheek flushed warmly.</p>

<p>"I shall have to confess," she said. "But you must
not judge me too hardly, Captain Lancaster."</p>

<p>He looked at her expectantly.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the truth," she said. "I went early to
my state-room, because I was tired of Lieutenant De Vere.
I wanted to be alone. But it was so warm and close in
my room, I could not breathe freely. So I threw a dark
shawl over me and went out on deck again. There was no
one there. I slipped around in the shadow of the wheel-house
and sat down."</p>

<p>"And then we came&mdash;De Vere and I," said Lancaster.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "I was frightened at first, and
shrank closer into the darkness. I did not want to be
found out. I thought you would smoke your cigars and
go away in a little while."</p>

<p>There was a minute's silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had been a thousand miles away!" the captain
thought, ruefully, to himself.</p>

<p>"So then you commenced to talk about me," continued
Leonora. "I ought not to have listened, I know, but I
could not make up my mind to interrupt you; it would
have been so embarrassing, you know. So I kept still,
hoping you would stop every minute, and thus I heard
all."</p>

<p>"You heard nothing but kindness&mdash;you must grant
that, at least," he said.</p>

<p>The red lips curled at the corners, whether with anger
or feeling he could not tell.</p>

<p>"You were very condescending," she said, in a quiet,
very demure little voice.</p>

<p>"Now, you wrong us&mdash;you do, indeed, Miss West," he
cried, hotly. "We said the kindest things of you. You
must own that Lieutenant De Vere paid you the highest
compliment man can pay to woman."</p>

<p>A beautiful blush rose into the fair face, and her eyes
drooped a moment.</p>

<p>"While we are upon the subject," he continued, hastily,
"let me speak a word for my friend, Miss West. He
is quite in earnest in his love for you, and you would do
well to listen to his suit. He is in every way an unexceptionable
suitor. There is everything in favor of him, personally,
and he is of good birth, is the heir to a title, and
last, but not least, has ten thousand a year of his own."</p>

<p>"Enough to buy him a more fitting bride than Mrs.
West's niece," she said, with some bitterness, but more
mirth, in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who could be more fitting than the one he has
chosen?" asked Lancaster.</p>

<p>"It would be a <i>mésalliance</i>," she said, with her eyes
full on his face as she quoted his words.</p>

<p>"In the world's eyes&mdash;yes," he answered, quietly.
"But if you love him and he loves you, you need not care
for the world," he said; and he felt the whole force of the
words as he spoke them. He said to himself that any
man who could afford to snap his fingers at fortune and
marry Leonora West would be blessed.</p>

<p>She listened to his words calmly, and with an air of
thoughtfulness, as if she were weighing them in her mind.</p>

<p>"And so," she said, when he had ceased speaking,
"you advise me, Captain Lancaster, to follow up the good
impression I have made on your friend, and to&mdash;to fall
into his arms as soon as he asks me?"</p>

<p>He gave a gasp as if she had thrown cold water over
him.</p>

<p>"Pray do not understand me as advising anything!" he
cried, hastily. "I merely showed you the advantages of
such a marriage; but, of course, I have no personal interest
in the matter. I am no match-maker."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," curtly; then, with a sudden total
change of the subject, she said: "Aren't we very near the
end of our trip, Captain Lancaster?"</p>

<p>"You are tired?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. It grows monotonous after the first day or two
out," she replied.</p>

<p>"You might have had a better time if you had let De
Vere and me amuse you," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I have been amused," she replied, frankly; and
he wondered within himself what had amused her, but did
not ask. She had a trick of saying things that chagrined
him, because he did not understand them, and had a lingering
suspicion that she was laughing at him.</p>

<p>"We shall see the end of our journey to-morrow, if we
have good luck," he said, and she uttered an exclamation
of pleasure.</p>

<p>"So soon? Ah, how glad I am! I wonder," reflectively,
"what my aunt will think about me."</p>

<p>"She will be astonished, for one thing," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I think she is expecting a child. She will be
surprised to see a young lady."</p>

<p>"Poor papa!" a sigh; "he always called me his little
girl. That is how the mistake has been made. Ah, Captain
Lancaster, I can not tell you how much I miss my
father!"</p>

<p>There was a tremor in the young voice. His heart
thrilled with pity for her loneliness.</p>

<p>"I hope your aunt will be so kind to you that she will
make up to you for his loss," he said.</p>

<p>"Tell me something about her," said Leonora.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can not tell you much," he answered,
with some embarrassment. "She is a good woman. I
have heard Lady Lancaster say that much."</p>

<p>"Of course, you can not be expected to know much
about a mere housekeeper," with a distinct inflection of
bitterness in her voice. "Well, then, tell me about Lady
Lancaster. Who is she?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is the mistress of Lancaster Park."</p>

<p>"Is she nice?"</p>

<p>"She is old and ugly and cross and very rich. Is all
that nice, as you define it?"</p>

<p>"No; only the last. It is nice to be rich, of course.
That goes without saying. Well, then, is there a master?"</p>

<p>"A master?" vaguely.</p>

<p>"Of Lancaster Park, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"And is he old and ugly and cross and rich?" pursued
Miss West, curiously.</p>

<p>"He is all but the last," declared Lancaster, unblushingly.
"He is as poor as Job's turkey. That is not nice,
is it?"</p>

<p>"I know some people who are poor, but very, very nice,"
said the girl, with a decided air.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so. I am very poor myself.
I have been thinking that the reason you have snubbed
me so unmercifully of late is because I so foolishly gave
myself away when I first met you."</p>

<p>"Gave yourself away?" uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>"I mean I told you I was poor. I beg your pardon for
the slang phrase I used just now. One falls unconsciously
into such habits in the army. But tell me, did you?"</p>

<p>"Did I do what?"</p>

<p>"Did you snub me because I am poor?"</p>

<p>"I have not snubbed you at all," indignantly.</p>

<p>"You have ignored me. That is even worse," he said.</p>

<p>"Indeed I have not ignored you at all," she protested.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you forgot me. That is the unkindest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
cut of all. I could bear to be snubbed, but I hate to be
totally annihilated," said he, with a grieved air.</p>

<p>She pursed her pretty lips and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Now you want me to go away, I see," he remarked.
"This is the first time you have let me talk to you since
we came aboard, and already you are weary."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am already weary," she echoed.</p>

<p>She put her little hand over her lips and yawned daintily
but deliberately.</p>

<p>Burning with chagrin, he lifted his hat to her and
walked away.</p>

<p>"I can never speak to her but she makes me repent,"
he said to himself, and went and leaned moodily against
the side, while he continued to himself: "What a little
thorn she is, and how sharply she can wound."</p>

<p>Leonora watched the retreating figure a moment, then
leisurely opened her book again and settled herself to
read. But she was not very deeply interested, it seemed,
for now and then she glanced up under her long lashes at
the tall, moveless figure of the soldier. At length she put
down the book and went across to him.</p>

<p>Gazing intently out to sea, he started when a hand soft
and white as a snow-flake fluttered down upon his coat-sleeve.
He glanced quickly around.</p>

<p>"Miss West!" he exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>She glanced up deprecatingly into his face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was rude to you just now," she stammered. "I
beg your pardon for it. I&mdash;I really don't know why I was
so. I don't dislike you, indeed, and I think you are very
nice. I have enjoyed the chair and the books, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
been sorry ever since that day when I came down to the
steamer and did not wait for you. But&mdash;somehow&mdash;it was
very hard to tell you so."</p>

<p>She had spoken every word with a delightful shyness,
and after a pause, she went on, with a catch in her breath:</p>

<p>"As for your being poor, I never thought of that&mdash;never.
I think poor men are the nicest&mdash;always. They
are handsomer than the rich ones. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She caught her breath with a gasp. He had turned
around quickly and caught her hand.</p>

<p>"Miss West&mdash;" he was beginning to say, when a sudden
step sounded beside them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Vere had come up to them. There was
a sudden glitter in his brown eyes&mdash;a jealous gleam.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Are you and Miss West rehearsing
for private theatricals?" he asked, with a slight sarcastic
inflection.</p>

<p>Lancaster looked intensely annoyed; Leonora only
laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Do you not think that I should
make a good actress, Lieutenant De Vere?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "and Lancaster would make a good
actor. 'One man in his time plays many parts.'"</p>

<p>Lancaster looked at him with a lightning gleam in his
blue eyes. There was a superb scorn in them.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he replied. "And to carry out your
idea, I will now make my exit."</p>

<p>He bowed royally and walked away. De Vere laughed
uneasily; Leonora had coolly gone back to her book. His
eyes flashed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"If anyone had told me this, I should not have believed
it," he muttered. "Ah! it was well to lecture me and
get the game into his own hands. Beggar! what could he
give her, even if she bestowed her matchless self upon him&mdash;what
but a barren honor, an empty title? Ah, well! false
friend, I know all now," he hissed angrily to himself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>Leonora, apparently absorbed in her book, watched her
exasperated admirer curiously under her long, shady
lashes. She divined intuitively that he was bitterly jealous
of his handsome friend.</p>

<p>"Have I stirred up strife between them?" she asked
herself, uneasily. "That will never do. I must carry the
olive branch to the distrustful friend."</p>

<p>She glanced around, and seeing that Lancaster was not
in sight, called gently:</p>

<p>"Lieutenant De Vere!"</p>

<p>He hurried toward her, and stood in grim silence awaiting
her pleasure.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;want to speak to you," she said.</p>

<p>There was a vacant chair near at hand. He brought it
and sat down by her side.</p>

<p>"I am at your service, Miss West," he said, stiffly.</p>

<p>He thought he had never seen anything half so enchanting
as the face she raised to his. The big black hat was a
most becoming foil to her fresh young beauty. There was
a smile on the rosy lips&mdash;half arch, half wistful. The full
light of the sunny day shone on her, but her beauty was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
flawless that the severe test only enhanced its perfection.
His heart gave a fierce throb, half pain, half pleasure.</p>

<p>"You are vexed with me?" said Leonora, in a soft, inquiring
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," he replied, quickly.</p>

<p>"No?" she said. "But, then, you certainly are vexed
with some one. If it is not with me, then it must be with
Captain Lancaster."</p>

<p>To this proposition, that was made with an air of conviction,
he remained gravely silent.</p>

<p>"Silence gives consent," said the girl, after waiting
vainly for him to speak, and then he bowed coldly.</p>

<p>"Then it is he," she said. "Ah, dear me! what has
Captain Lancaster done?"</p>

<p>"That is between him and me," said the soldier, with a
sulky air.</p>

<p>The red lips dimpled. Leonora rather enjoyed the situation.</p>

<p>"You will not tell me?" she said.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;no," he answered, resolutely.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you," she said: "you think he has
treated you unfairly, that he has taken advantage of you."</p>

<p>De Vere stared.</p>

<p>"How can you possibly know, Miss West?" he asked,
pulling sulkily at the ends of his dark mustache.</p>

<p>"I am very good at guessing," demurely.</p>

<p>"You did not guess this. He told you, I presume,"
bitterly.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;if you mean Captain Lancaster&mdash;told me nothing.
I was telling him something. Why should you be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
vexed at him because I went and stood there and talked to
him?" indignantly.</p>

<p>"I was not," rather feebly.</p>

<p>"Do you really deny it?" she asked him, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Well, since you put it so seriously, yes, I was vexed
about it; but I don't understand how you could know it,"
he answered, flushing a dark red.</p>

<p>"I will tell you how I know," she said, coloring crimson
also. "I heard all that you and Captain Lancaster
said about me that first night we came aboard."</p>

<p>"Oh, by Jove! you didn't, though?" he exclaimed,
radiant, and trying to meet the glance of the beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>But with her shy avowal she had let the white lids drop
bashfully over them.</p>

<p>De Vere was not one bit disconcerted by what she had
told him. He knew that all she had heard that night had
been to his advantage.</p>

<p>"And so all this while you knew that I thought&mdash;" he
began, boldly.</p>

<p>"That you thought me rather pretty&mdash;yes," she replied,
modestly. "I knew also that I was a <i>mésalliance</i> for you,
and that Captain Lancaster's future was 'cut and dried,'"
bitterly.</p>

<p>He gazed at her in wonder.</p>

<p>"And you have kept it to yourself all this while, Miss
West?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because I was ashamed to confess the truth. I
did not want to be thought an eavesdropper, for I did not
really wish to hear. It was an accident, but it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
weighed on my mind ever since, and at last I made up my
mind to 'fess, as the children say."</p>

<p>He gazed at her with ever-increasing admiration.</p>

<p>"So," she went on, slowly, "this evening I told Captain
Lancaster all about it."</p>

<p>She blushed at the remembrance of some other things
she had told him&mdash;things she had not meant to tell, but
which had slipped out, as it were, in her compunction at
her rudeness to him.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;that was all? Was he not making love to you,
really?" cried the lieutenant, still uneasy at the remembrance
of that impulsive hand-clasp that had so amazed
him.</p>

<p>She flashed her great eyes at him in superb anger.</p>

<p>"Love to me&mdash;he would not dare!" breathlessly. "I'm
nothing to him, nothing to you&mdash;never shall be! Please
remember that! Once I reach my aunt, neither of you
need ever expect to see me again. I&mdash;I&mdash;" a strangling
sob; she broke down and wept out her anger in a perfumed
square of black-bordered cambric.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray, don't cry!" cried he, in distress. "I did
not mean to make you angry, Miss West;" and then
Leonora hastily dried her eyes and looked up at him.</p>

<p>"I'm not angry&mdash;really," she said. "Only&mdash;only, I
want you to understand that you need not be angry with
Captain Lancaster on my account. There's no use in
your liking me and having a quarrel over me&mdash;no use at
all."</p>

<p>"No one has quarreled," he answered, in a tone of chagrin
and bitter disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet, of course," she replied shaking her head
gravely. "But you know you spoke to him very aggravatingly
just now."</p>

<p>"I merely used a quotation from Shakespeare," he
retorted.</p>

<p>The bright eyes looked him through and through with
their clear gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes, but there was a double meaning in it. I am sure
he understood all that you meant to convey. I should
think that when you meet him again he will knock you
down for it."</p>

<p>"You are charmingly frank, but you are right. I do
not doubt but that he will&mdash;if he can," he replied, bitterly.</p>

<p>Leonora measured the medium-sized figure critically with
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I should think there could be no doubt on the subject,"
she observed. "He is twice as big as you are."</p>

<p>"Why do women all admire big, awkward giants?"
asked he, warmly.</p>

<p>"We do not," sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss West, there's no use denying it. There are
a dozen men in the Guards better looking than Lancaster,
yet not one so much run after by the women; all because
he is a brawny-fisted Hercules," crossly.</p>

<p>"Captain Lancaster is your friend, isn't he?" with a
curling lip.</p>

<p>"He was before I saw you. He is not my friend if he is
my rival," said De Vere, with frankness equal to her own.</p>

<p>The round cheeks grew crimson again.</p>

<p>"Put me out of the question. I am nothing to either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of you&mdash;never can be," she said. "You have been
friends, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," curtly.</p>

<p>"For a long time?" persisted she.</p>

<p>"Ever since I went into the Guards&mdash;that is five years
ago," he replied. "The fellows used to call us Damon
and Pythias."</p>

<p>"Then don't&mdash;don't let me make a quarrel between
you!" exclaimed Leonora, pleadingly.</p>

<p>"It is already made, isn't it?" with a half regret in his
voice.</p>

<p>"No; only begun&mdash;and you mustn't let it go any further."</p>

<p>"No? But what is a fellow to do, I should like to
know?"</p>

<p>"You must go and apologize to your friend for your
hasty, ill-timed words," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I show the white feather like that!"
he cried, violently.</p>

<p>"There is no white feather at all. You made a mistake
and spoke unjust words to your friend. Now, when you
discover your error, you should be man enough to retract
your remarks," she answered, indignantly.</p>

<p>"I can't see why you take up for Lancaster so vehemently,"
he commented, straying from the main point.</p>

<p>"I'm not taking up for him," warmly. "I only don't
want you to make a fool of yourself about <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah!"&mdash;shortly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I mean, exactly; I don't want my
aunt to think I've set you two at odds. She will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
prejudiced against me in the beginning. Come, now,"
dropping her vexed tone and falling into a coaxing one,
"go and make it up with your injured Pythias."</p>

<p>He regarded her in silence a moment.</p>

<p>"Should you like me any better if I did?" he inquired,
after this thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>"Of course I should," she answered, in an animated
tone.</p>

<p>"And it would really please you for me to tell Lancaster
I was mistaken and am sorry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like that, certainly."</p>

<p>He tried to look into the sparkling eyes, but they had
wandered away from him. She was watching the flight of
a sea-bird whose glancing wings were almost lost in the
illimitable blue of the sky.</p>

<p>"If I do this thing it will be wholly for your sake," he
said, meaningly.</p>

<p>"For my sake, then," she answered, carelessly; and
then he rose and left her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lancaster had been in his state-room reading two hours,
perhaps, when De Vere knocked at his door. He tossed
back his fair hair carelessly, and without rising from his
reclining posture, bade the applicant come in.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is you, De Vere?" he said, icily.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I, Lancaster. What have you been doing?
Writing a challenge to me?" laughing. "Well, you may
burn it now; I have come to retract my words."</p>

<p>"To retract?" the frown on Lancaster's moody brow
began to clear away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I was mistaken, I thought you were my rival in
secret, but Miss West has explained all to me. I spoke
unjustly. Can you accord me your pardon? I'm downright
sorry, old fellow&mdash;no mistake."</p>

<p>Lancaster gave him his hand.</p>

<p>"Think before you speak next time," he said, dryly.</p>

<p>"I will. But I was terribly cut up at first, seeing you
and her together&mdash;like that. How sweet she is! She did
not want us to quarrel over her. She confessed everything.
It was comical, her hearing everything that night&mdash;was
it not? But there was no harm done."</p>

<p>"No," Lancaster said, constrainedly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we are friends again; but I was so stiff I
could never have owned myself in the wrong, only that I
promised to do it for her sake," added De Vere; and then
he went away, and left his friend to resume the interrupted
perusal of his novel.</p>

<p>But Lancaster tossed the folio angrily down upon the
floor.</p>

<p>"For her sake," he replied. "She is a little coquette,
after all, and I thought for an hour that&mdash;Pshaw, I am a
fool! So she has fooled him to the top of his bent, too!
Why did I speak to her at all? Little nettle! I might
have known how she would sting! Well, well, I wish the
'small commission' were duly handed over to the housekeeper
at Lancaster Park. A good riddance, I should say!
So she thought that poor men were the nicest and handsomest,
always? Faugh! Lucky for me that De Vere came
upon the scene just then! In another minute I should
have told her that I thought just the same about poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
girls! So she confessed all to De Vere, and bade him apologize
for her sake. Ah, ah, little flirt!" he repeated, bitterly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Things went on smoothly as usual at Lancaster Park
after Mrs. West had given her consent to my lady's clever
plan. They put Richard West's child out of their heads
for awhile and began their preparations for the guests who
were expected to arrive the last of May, to welcome the returning
master of Lancaster Park. Mrs. West found time
in the hubbub to fit up a tidy little room next her own for
the little American niece who was coming to her from so
far away. Then she, too, dismissed the matter from her
mind, save now and then when in solitary moments she
would wonder to herself what Dick West's child would be
like, and if she would be old enough to put to school.</p>

<p>"It is lucky that I have a good store of savings,"
thought the lonely woman to herself. "I will find a good
boarding-school for little Leonora, if she is old enough to
go, and the child shall be educated for a teacher, that she
may have the means of supporting herself genteelly when
she grows up. It will take a good deal of money, but I
will not begrudge it to poor Dick's child. He was a good-hearted,
sunny-tempered lad. I only hope his child may be
like him."</p>

<p>So she went on thinking of the child as of a very small
girl indeed. Her brother-in-law's letter, with its hurried
mention of "my little girl," "my little Leo," had entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
misled her. The poor dying man had had no intention
of deceiving his sister-in-law. To him his darling
daughter, although grown to woman's stature, was always
"my little girl," and it never occurred to him, when on
his dying bed he penned that hurried letter, to explain to
Mrs. West that his orphan child was a beautiful young girl
of eighteen, already fairly educated, and with a spirit quite
brave enough to face the world alone, if need be.</p>

<p>So she went on thinking of Leonora West as a little girl
who would be a great deal of trouble to her, and on whom
she would have to spend the savings of long years; and,
although she felt that she had a formidable task before her
in the rearing of this orphan girl, she did not shrink from
the undertaking, but made up her mind to go forward
bravely in the fulfillment of the precious charge left to her
by the dead.</p>

<p>So the day drew near for Leonora's arrival, and the
great house was now filled with guests&mdash;twenty in all&mdash;whom
Lady Lancaster had bidden to the feast, prepared in
honor of her nephew, the Lord of Lancaster.</p>

<p>So the day was come at last, and Lady Lancaster in the
drawing-room awaited her nephew, while the housekeeper
in the kitchen awaited her niece.</p>

<p>It was one of the most beautiful of June days. The air
was sweet and warm, the sky was clear and blue, all nature
seemed to smile on the home-coming of the master.</p>

<p>Mrs. West, having given her orders in the kitchen, repaired
to her own special sitting-room, a small apartment
on the second floor, with a sunny window looking out upon
the rear grounds of the house. She had put a bouquet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
roses in a vase on the mantel, and some small pots of
simple, sweet-smelling flowers on the window-sill, to
brighten up the place for the child's eyes.</p>

<p>"It will look so cheerful. Children always love
flowers," she said.</p>

<p>She pulled forward a pretty little child's rocking-chair
that she had brought down from the immense garret. She
arranged a pretty little red-and-white tidy over the back.</p>

<p>"In a little while they will be here, for John went to
meet them with the carriage a good while ago," she said
to herself. "Dear me, how nervous I am getting over
that child's coming."</p>

<p>And she settled her lace cap again and looked into the
small mirror against the wall, wondering how Dick's child
would like her aunt's looks.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Mrs. West, I did not think you were so
vain," said a laughing masculine voice.</p>

<p>She turned around quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, so you're come home again!" she cried;
"and as full of your mischief as ever. Welcome, welcome!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am home again, Mrs. West, and here is what I
have brought you," he said, stepping back that she might
see the girl who had followed him into the room&mdash;the
graceful figure in deep black, that came up to her with
both hands outstretched, and said, demurely:</p>

<p>"How do you do, Aunt West?"</p>

<p>For a minute Mrs. West did not touch the pretty white
hands held out to her, she was so amazed and surprised.
She managed to stammer out faintly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you Leonora West? I&mdash;I was expecting to see a
very young child."</p>

<p>The bright face dimpled charmingly.</p>

<p>"That was a mistake," she said. "I hope you will not
be vexed because I am so large!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>"But," said Mrs. West, in perplexity, "the letter said
a little girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Leonora. "Poor papa always
called me his little girl, and if he had lived until I was an
old woman it would have been the same. And he forgot
that you could not possibly know how old I was. I'm
sorry you are disappointed, Aunt West, but I am eighteen
years old. You see, papa was married one year after he
went to America&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just here Captain Lancaster interposed:</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to kiss your niece, Mrs. West?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, yes; I was so surprised, I quite forgot!"
cried the good woman. She went up to Leonora, put her
arms around the graceful figure, and kissed the round
cheek.</p>

<p>"Welcome to England, my dear child," she said. "I
shall love you dearly, I am sure. Sit down, do, in this
chair, while I take your things."</p>

<p>And in her flurry she pushed forward the small rocking-chair
with elaborate courtesy, whereat Leonora laughed
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Either the chair is too small, or I am too big," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
said; "I am afraid to trust myself upon it." She went
and sat down on a pretty old-fashioned sofa. Then she
glanced around and saw that Captain Lancaster had gone.</p>

<p>"Are you disappointed because I am not a little girl,
Aunt West?" she inquired, as she removed her hat and
smoothed her rough tresses with her small, white hands.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;yet," said the good woman; "I am
so flustered by the surprise, and&mdash;and&mdash;I wonder what
Lady Lancaster will say?"</p>

<p>"What has Lady Lancaster to do with me?" demanded
Miss West, in her pretty, abrupt way, fixing her large eyes
wonderingly on her aunt's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" answered Mrs. West, rather vaguely.</p>

<p>"I should think not, indeed," said Leonora, in a very
decided tone.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, my dear? Should you like to go to
your room and rest?" inquired the housekeeper, changing
the subject.</p>

<p>"No, I am not tired, thank you, aunt; but I will go to
my room if you please," Leonora answered. There was
a little disappointment in her tone. The young face
looked sober.</p>

<p>"This way, then, my dear," said Mrs. West. She led
the girl through her own neat bedroom, into a prettier
one, small, but furnished with a white bed, a blue carpet,
and some blue chairs&mdash;these latter also the spoils of the
garret, but looking very well after the furbishing Mrs.
West had given them.</p>

<p>Leonora cast a rapid, comprehensive glance around her,
then went over to the ewer and bathed her face and hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope your room suits you, Leonora," said Mrs.
West, lingering, and half-abashed. Something about the
fair, self-possessed girl seemed to vaguely suggest better
things. Beside her grace and beauty the room looked poor
and mean.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you, aunt," Leonora returned, quietly.
She had taken her combs and brushes out of her
dressing-bag now, and Mrs. West saw that they were an
expensive set, pearl and silver-backed, as elegant as Lady
Lancaster's own.</p>

<p>"My dear, could your papa afford handsome things like
these?" she said.</p>

<p>Leonora flushed rose red.</p>

<p>"Not always," she said. "But he was very extravagant
whenever he had money. He made a great pet of
me, and sometimes&mdash;when he had good luck&mdash;he bought
the loveliest things for me. Perhaps, if he had taken
more care of his money, you need not have been burdened
with the care of his orphan daughter now."</p>

<p>There was a dejected tone in her voice that went
straight to the housekeeper's womanly heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor fatherless child!" she cried. "Do you
think I could mind dividing my savings with Dick West's
child? He was a bonny lad, was Dick! I always loved
him, although he was no real kin to me, and only my husband's
brother."</p>

<p>Leonora's eyes shone very bright now through the tears
that filled them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt West, you will love me too a little, then&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
poor papa's sake!" she cried, and Mrs. West answered,
with sudden warmth and tenderness:</p>

<p>"Indeed I will, dear. You shall be like my own daughter
to me."</p>

<p>A moment later she added, ruefully:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I could not have a nicer room for you,
Leonora. But, you see, I thought this would do very well
for a child."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, it does not matter in the least. I shall
not stay in it much. I shall be out-of-doors nearly all the
time."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Leonora spoke in such a composed, matter-of-fact tone
that she was surprised at its effect upon her aunt.</p>

<p>The good lady uttered an exclamation almost amounting
to terror, and stood regarding her niece with such a
rueful and amazed face that the girl burst into a peal of
sweet, high-pitched laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear aunt," she cried, as she vigorously
brushed out her thick plaits of hair into loose, shining ripples
over her shoulders, "what have I said to shock you
so?"</p>

<p>"I'm not shocked, my dear," said the good soul, recovering
herself, with a gasp. "What put such an idea in
your head? But what did you say, child," anxiously,
"about being out all day?"</p>

<p>"I said it didn't matter about the room, as I didn't expect
to stay in it much. I love fresh air, Aunt West, and
I shall be out-doors nearly all the time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid that won't do here, my love," suggested
the housekeeper, timidly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Leonora, amazed; then she colored,
and said, demurely: "Oh, yes, I understand now. You
can not spare me. I shall have to help work for my living."</p>

<p>"No, you shall not," indignantly; "I did not mean
that at all. I should be mean if I thought of such a
thing. But there's Lady Lancaster. She wouldn't like
it."</p>

<p>A pretty little frown came between Leonora's straight,
dark brows.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like me to go out-doors? Is that what
you mean?" she asked, and when Mrs. West answered
"Yes," she said, angrily and decidedly:</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster has nothing to do with my movements,
and I don't suppose she will grudge me a breath of
God's free air and sunshine even if I walk in her grounds
to obtain them."</p>

<p>"But I promised her&mdash;" said Mrs. West, then paused
bashfully.</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't promise her to bury me alive in this
musty little chamber, at all events," said the girl, with an
irreverent glance around her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. At least I promised to keep you out of
her sight. She does not like children."</p>

<p>"I'm not a child," said Leonora, looking her tallest.</p>

<p>"Yes. I forgot that. I will ask her if her objections
extend to a young lady," Mrs. West said, with a hesitating
air. She was a little afraid of a contretemps of some kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
The girl's great eyes were flashing, her pretty red lips curling
disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Aunt West, are you going to stay on at Lancaster
Park, and am I to stay here with you?" she asked, slowly.</p>

<p>"That was my expectation, dear," the housekeeper
answered, mildly.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;am I here on Lady Lancaster's sufferance?
Am I&mdash;hired to her?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, of course not, Leonora, child. She has
nothing at all to do with you. My lady was very kind.
She did not send me away because I was about to adopt a
daughter. She permitted me to have you here, and she
made but one condition."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"That I was to keep you limited to my rooms&mdash;to keep
you out of her sight. She did not want to be pestered by
a child."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Leonora drew a long breath, as with her white
fingers she patted the soft rings of hair down upon her
white forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can not blame her, surely, dear. You see,
my lady is an old woman. She is eighty years old, and she
has never had any children. So of course she would not
like to be bothered with other people's. She is very ill-natured,
and very peculiar, but perhaps when she finds out
you are a young lady she will not care if you go out into
the grounds some."</p>

<p>"And to the house, Aunt West&mdash;am not I to go over
that? Papa has told me so much about these grand old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
English homes. I should like to go over one so much,"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"I will take you over the house myself, some day. You
shall see it, never fear, child, but not for some time yet.
You see, the place is full of grand company now."</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster's company?" asked Leonora.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course," said Mrs. West. "She has
twenty guests&mdash;fine, fashionable people from London, and
they are all very gay indeed. You shall see them all at
dinner this evening. I will find you a peep-hole. It will
be a fine sight for you."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Leonora, speaking rather indistinctly,
because she had two pins in her mouth and was
fastening a clean linen collar around her neck.</p>

<p>"How coolly she takes things! I suppose that is the
American way," thought Mrs. West. "But then of
course she can have no idea what a brave sight it is to see
the English nobility dining at a great country-house. She
will be quite dazzled by the black coats and shining jewels
and beautiful dresses. I don't suppose they have anything
like it in her country," mused the good woman, whose
ideas of America were so vague that she did not suppose it
had advanced very far from the condition in which Columbus
discovered it.</p>

<p>"I should not think," said her niece, breaking in upon
these silent cogitations, "that Lady Lancaster, being so
old&mdash;'one foot in the grave and the other on the brink,'
as they say&mdash;would care about all that gay company
around her. Does she lead such a life always?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It is only now and then she is so dissipated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
But she must keep up the dignity of the Hall, you know,
for the sake of Lord Lancaster. All this present gayety
is in honor of his return."</p>

<p>"Has Lord Lancaster been abroad, then?" Leonora
asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Why, my love, what a strange question!" said her
aunt, staring.</p>

<p>"What is there strange about it, Aunt West?" asked
the girl.</p>

<p>"Why, that you should ask me if Lord Lancaster has
been abroad&mdash;as if any one should know better than yourself."</p>

<p>"I, Aunt West? Why, what should I know of Lady
Lancaster's husband?" exclaimed Leonora, wondering if
her aunt's brain were not just a little turned.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear girl, who said anything about her husband?
She's a dowager. The old Lord Lancaster has
been dead these two years. Of course I meant the young
heir."</p>

<p>"The old lady's son?" asked Leonora, irreverently.</p>

<p>"Her nephew, my dear. You know I told you just
now that she never had a child."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I was very careless to forget that. I beg
your pardon. So then it is her nephew who has been
abroad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, or rather her husband's nephew," replied Mrs.
West.</p>

<p>"Where has he been, aunt?" continued the girl, carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. West looked as if she thought Leonora had parted
with her senses, if ever she had possessed any.</p>

<p>"Why, he has been to America, of course. Didn't he
fetch you to England, Leonora? And hasn't he but just
gone out of the room? Are you making fun of your old
auntie, dear?"</p>

<p>Leonora stood still, looking at her relative with a pale,
startled face.</p>

<p>"Why, that was Captain Lancaster," she said, faintly
after a minute.</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Mrs. West. "He's an officer
in the army, but he is Lord Lancaster, of Lancaster Park,
too. Dear me, dear me, didn't you really know that
much, Leonora?"</p>

<p>"N-no; I didn't. I thought he was nothing but a soldier.
He&mdash;he told me that he was as poor as&mdash;as a church-mouse!"
faltered Leonora, as red as a rose, and with a
lump in her throat. She was just on the point of breaking
down and crying with vexation. How had he dared
chaff her so?</p>

<p>"Well, so he is poor&mdash;not as poor as a church-mouse, of
course, for he has Lancaster Park and five thousand acres
of woodland; but then he has no money&mdash;it was all squandered
by the dead-and-gone lords of Lancaster. So Captain
Clive Lancaster never left the army when he came
into the title. He could not support it properly, and so
my lady lives on here, and some day, if he marries to
please her, she will give him all her money," said Mrs.
West, volubly.</p>

<p>Leonora went over to the window, and stood looking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
at the fair, peaceful English landscape in silence. Her
readiness of speech seemed to have deserted her. The
pretty face was pale with surprise.</p>

<p>"You must be tired, dear. Do lie down and rest yourself,"
said Mrs. West. "I must leave you now for a little
while. Oh, I had almost forgotten&mdash;your luggage, Leonora&mdash;did
you bring any?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there were several trunks," Leonora answered,
without turning her head.</p>

<p>"I will have them brought in," said Mrs. West. Then
she bustled away and left the girl alone.</p>

<p>She was not tired, probably, for she did not lie down.
She only pulled a chair to the window and sat down.
Then she clasped her small hands together on the window-sill,
rested her round, dimpled chin upon them, and gazed
at the sky with a thoughtful, far-off look in her eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. West's mind teemed with uneasy
thoughts.</p>

<p>"She's rather strange, I'm afraid," the good woman
said to herself. "I think, perhaps, poor Dick has humored
her some&mdash;she will not bear restraint well&mdash;I can
see that! And what will Lady Lancaster say to a grown-up
girl instead of a little one, as we expected? I'm afraid
I see rocks ahead. And yet how pretty and bright she is&mdash;too
pretty to belong to the housekeeper's room, I'm
afraid. Lady Lancaster will be vexed at her, if ever she
sees her. She is too independent in her ways to suit my
lady. They must not be allowed to meet as long as I can
help it," sighing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>Lady Lancaster was pleased to be very gracious indeed
to her returned nephew.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are as big and handsome as ever, Clive!" she
said, "and well, of course. I believe you never were sick
in your life?"</p>

<p>"Hardly ever," he replied, with a laugh, adding, with
veiled anxiety: "I hear that you have killed the fatted
calf in my honor, Aunt Lydia. Whom have you staying
with you?"</p>

<p>"A few nice people from London, Clive&mdash;twenty in all,
I think. There are old Lord and Lady Brierly, and their
son and daughter, Sir Charles Winton, Colonel Livingston,
Mark Dean and his pretty sister, the Earl of Eastwood
and his beautiful daughter, Lady Adela, the Cliffords,
and some other people. You will meet them all
at dinner. I think you know them all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," he answered, rather absently.</p>

<p>"To-night there will be a little informal dance&mdash;the
young folks were so eager for it, you know. And, Clive,
that young friend of yours, Lieutenant De Vere&mdash;I hope
you brought him down with you?"</p>

<p>"I did not," he replied.</p>

<p>"I am sorry; but I shall send him a note to-morrow.
Did you have a fair trip over, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Very fair," he replied, in a peculiar tone.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that. Oh, by the way, Clive, did
you bring that child to the housekeeper?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, and a slight smile twitched the corners
of the mustached lips.</p>

<p>"I hope she wasn't troublesome," said the haughty old
lady, carelessly.</p>

<p>"She was troublesome&mdash;I suppose all of the female sex
are," he answered, lightly.</p>

<p>"Well, it couldn't be helped, or I would not have
bothered you. I had to send for the young one, or West
would have gone off herself to fetch her. I'm glad you
brought her. The trouble is all over now, so I suppose
you don't care."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Captain Lancaster, with rather grim
pleasantry.</p>

<p>And then she touched him on the arm and said, significantly:</p>

<p>"There's some one here I want very much for you to
meet, Clive."</p>

<p>"Ah, is there?" he said, shrinking a little from the
look and the tone. "I thought you wanted me to meet
them all."</p>

<p>"I do; but there is one in particular. It is a lady,
Clive," she said, giving him a significant smile that he
thought hideous.</p>

<p>He tried gently to wrench himself away from her.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go and take my siesta and dress before
I meet them," he said.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Clive. I must speak to you," she
said, in a tone that savored of authority.</p>

<p>"Will not some other time do as well?" he inquired,
glancing rather ungallantly at his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"No time like the present," she answered, resolutely.
"You are trying to put me off again, Clive; but beware
how you trifle with me, my Lord Lancaster, or I shall
know how to punish you," she said, shaking her skinny,
diamond-ringed finger at him.</p>

<p>His handsome face flushed haughtily.</p>

<p>"Go on, madame," he said, with a slight, mocking
bow. "I am the slave of your pleasure."</p>

<p>She regarded the handsome, insubordinate face in dead
silence a minute.</p>

<p>"You already anticipate what I would say," she said.
"Why is the idea so distasteful to you, Clive? Any young
man in your position might be transported with joy at the
thought of inheriting my fortune."</p>

<p>He bowed silently.</p>

<p>"You know," she went on, coolly, "you can never
come home to live on your ancestral acres unless you
marry money or inherit it."</p>

<p>"Thanks to the folly of my predecessors," he said, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Never mind your predecessors, Clive. There is a
woman here whom I want you to marry. Win her and
make her mistress of Lancaster Park, and my fortune is
yours."</p>

<p>"Am I to have her for the asking?" he inquired, with
a delicate sarcasm.</p>

<p>"It is very likely you may," she answered. "Handsome
faces like yours make fools of most women."</p>

<p>"And who is the lady it is to charm in this case?" he
inquired, with bitter brevity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the Lady Adela Eastwood," she replied, concisely.</p>

<p>He gave a low whistle of incredulity.</p>

<p>"The Lady Adela Eastwood&mdash;the daughter of a hundred
earls!" he cried. "Your ambition soars high, Aunt
Lydia."</p>

<p>"Not too high," she replied, shaking her old head
proudly, until the great red jewels in her ears flashed like
drops of blood.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>"Not too high," repeated Lady Lancaster, sagely.
"The lords of Lancaster have married earls' daughters
before to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes, in their palmy days," said Clive Lancaster;
"but not now, when their patrimony is wasted, their
lands encumbered with taxes, and their last descendant
earning a paltry living in her majesty's service."</p>

<p>"Lady Adela is as poor as you are," said the withered
old woman, significantly.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But I thought that the Earl of Eastwood was very
rich."</p>

<p>"He was once; but he and his spendthrift sons have
made ducks and drakes of the money at the gaming-table.
Lady Adela will have no portion at all. She will be compelled
to marry a fortune."</p>

<p>"So you have placed yours at her disposal?" he said,
with hardly repressed scorn.</p>

<p>"Yes," coolly, "if she takes my nephew with it. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
seriously, Clive, it is the best match for you both. You
will have money; she has beauty and exalted station.
Married to each other, you two will be a power in the
social world; apart, neither of you will count for much.
You will have rank, but that will be a mere incumbrance
to you without the ability to sustain its dignity properly."</p>

<p>"If you only knew how little I care for social power,"
he said. "The life of a soldier suits me. I have no great
ambition for wealth and power."</p>

<p>"You are no true Lancaster if you are willing to let the
old name and the old place run down!" she broke out, indignantly.
"Ah, I wish that I might have borne a son
to my husband! Then this degenerate scion of a noble
race need never have been roused from his <i>dolce far niente</i>
to sustain its ancient glory."</p>

<p>His lip curled in cold disdain of her wild ranting.</p>

<p>"At least the old name will never be dishonored by
me," he said. "I have led a life that no one can cry
shame upon. My record is pure."</p>

<p>Glancing at his flushed face and proud eyes, she saw
that she had gone too far. She did not want to rouse that
defiant mood inherent in all the Lancasters. She was
afraid of it.</p>

<p>"I was hasty," she said. "Forgive me, Clive. But I
am so anxious to have you fall in with my plans. I have
no kin of my own, and I am anxious to leave my money to
you, the heir of my late husband's title. If you fall in
with my views I shall give you from the day of your marriage
ten thousand a year, and after my death the whole
income shall be yours. If you cross me, if you decline to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
marry as I wish you to do, I shall hunt up other Lancasters&mdash;there
are distant connections in London, I think&mdash;and
I shall leave everything to them instead of to you."</p>

<p>Her black eyes glittered with menace, and there was an
evil, triumphant smile on her thin, cruel lips. She knew
the extent of her power, and was bent on using it to the
full.</p>

<p>"Money is a good thing to have, Aunt Lydia. I should
like to have yours when you are done with it, I don't deny
that," he said. "There may be some things better than
money, if," slowly, "one could have them, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better than money?" she interrupted, angry and sarcastic,
and frightened all at once, for fear that he was
about to refuse her. "Pray tell me what those desirable
things may be."</p>

<p>"You did not hear me out," he answered, calmly. "I
was about to say there might be, but I was not sure. We
will not discuss that unknown quantity."</p>

<p>"I think not," she answered, dryly. "It might be
more pertinent to discuss Lady Adela now. What do you
say, Clive? Shall you pay your court to her?"</p>

<p>A deep red flushed all over his fair, handsome face.</p>

<p>"She might decline the honor," he said.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! she might be a fool, but she isn't," said my
lady, sharply. "She will not decline. She has an inkling
of what I mean to do. I have talked with the earl. He
thinks it would be a pleasant and pertinent arrangement
for the house of Lancaster. You know you have to think
of your heirs, Clive, and to do the best you can for their
future."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he said, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Well, now I have told you all my hopes and plans,
Clive, I want to know what you are going to do. There is
no use beating about the bush," said my lady, sharply.</p>

<p>"I am going to make Lady Adela's acquaintance before
I make up my mind," he answered, undauntedly.</p>

<p>"You will fall in love with her. She is a great beauty,"
my lady said, confidently, as he bowed himself out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>That evening when "sober-suited twilight" had begun
to fall over all things, when the stars began to sparkle in
the sky, when the air began to be heavy with odors of rose
and mignonette and jasmine and the odorous, heavy-scented
honeysuckle, Mrs. West came into the sitting-room,
where Leonora was leaning from the window, drinking in
the peaceful sweetness of the summer eve.</p>

<p>"Are you lonely here in the dark, my dear? I will
bring a lamp," she said.</p>

<p>"Not yet, please, Aunt West," said the girl. "I love
this twilight dimness. I love to sit in the darkness and
think."</p>

<p>"About your poor papa, dear?" asked the good woman.
"Tell me about him, Leonora. What did he die of?"</p>

<p>"It was a fever, Aunt West. Some day I will tell you
all about him, but not just yet, please. I&mdash;can not bear it
yet. It has been so little a while since I lost him&mdash;barely
two months!" said Leonora, with the sound of tears in her
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, dear, I did not think. You shall tell me
when you please. But that was not what I came for. You
know I promised you a peep at the fine folks when they
dined. Well, it is time now. In a minute they will assemble.
Come with me; I have found a snug place for
you."</p>

<p>Leonora rose and followed her aunt. They went along
some dark corridors, hand in hand, silently, and then Mrs.
West put a key softly into a lock and turned it. A door
opened. A close, musty scent of dust and disuse breathed
in their faces. Mrs. West drew Leonora in and shut the
door.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid of the dark, dear," she whispered.
"It is only a disused china-closet opening on the dining-hall.
There is a broken panel. This way, Leonora.
Now, look."</p>

<p>There was a broken panel, indeed, that made an aperture
as wide as your hand. Through it there streamed a bar of
light, making visible the cobwebbed corners of the narrow
pantry, with piles of cracked and old-fashioned china
arranged upon the shelves, where the dust of years lay
thick and dark and musty. Leonora laughed a little at
the novelty of her position.</p>

<p>"Auntie, I feel like a naughty little girl who has hid in
the closet to steal preserves," she whispered.</p>

<p>Mrs. West laughed softly too.</p>

<p>"You will have something nicer than preserves," she
whispered, reassuringly, as if Leonora had indeed been a
little girl. "Now, dear, look, look!"</p>

<p>Leonora looked out through the narrow aperture, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dazzled by the radiant light for a moment, and saw a magnificent
dining-hall, long and lofty, with carved oak paneling,
and a tiled fire-place, a tapestried wall, and some
glorious paintings by the old masters, all lighted by a
magnificent chandelier of wax-lights, whose soft, luminous
blaze lighted up a table glittering with gold and silver
plate, costly crystal, and magnificent flowers. As she
gazed upon the brilliant scene there was a rustle, a murmur,
the echo of aristocratic laughter, and a gay party entered
the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. West, leaning over her niece's shoulder, whispered,
softly:</p>

<p>"There is my lady&mdash;in front, on that tall gentleman's
arm, dear."</p>

<p>Leonora saw a little, wizened figure in a glistening brocade,
with rubies pendent from the thin ears, a lace cap
on the thin white hair, a locket of diamonds and rubies on
the breast, and glittering bracelets that mocked the yellow,
bony wrists they encircled, and the sour, wrinkled
face, rendered even more ugly and aged by the attempts
that had been made to render it youthful.</p>

<p>"That hideous old lady in paint and powder&mdash;do you
say that she is Lady Lancaster?" Leonora asked; and
when Mrs. West answered "Yes," she said, irreverently:</p>

<p>"She looks like a witch, auntie, dear. I shall be expecting
every minute to see her gold-headed stick turned
into a broom, and herself flying away on it 'into the sky,
to sweep the cobwebs from on high.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, fy, my dear!" cried the housekeeper, disappointed
that Leonora had not been more impressed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
splendor of the scene and Lady Lancaster's dignity.
"But, look at Lord Lancaster&mdash;is he not grand in his
black suit?"</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Leonora, carelessly, as if she were not
gazing at that moment on the tall, superb figure, looking
courtly in its elegant evening-dress. He was walking by
the side of a lady whose white-gloved hand rested lightly
on his arm. Leonora looked admiringly at the dark, brilliant
face and stately figure of this woman, who, clothed
in ruby silk and rich black lace, looked queenly as she
sunk into her chair behind a beautiful épergne of fragrant
flowers.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see him now!" she said, after a minute. "He
is with that lady in ruby silk. Aunt West, who is she?"</p>

<p>"The Earl of Eastwood's daughter, Lady Adela. She
is a great beauty and a very grand lady."</p>

<p>"She is very handsome, certainly," Leonora said. Her
gaze lingered on the dark, brilliant face behind the flowers.
The dark eyes and red lips made a pretty picture. She
wondered if Captain Lancaster thought so.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is very handsome, and she will be the next
mistress of Lancaster Park," Mrs. West said.</p>

<p>"She is engaged to Captain&mdash;to Lord Lancaster,
then?" said Leonora. She looked at the earl's daughter
with a new interest.</p>

<p>"No, but every one knows what is in Lady Lancaster's
mind," said Mrs. West, significantly.</p>

<p>"It is dreadfully close here in this closet. One can
scarcely breathe," said Leonora. "Oh! Lady Lancaster,
you said. What has she to do with Lord Lancaster and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the earl's daughter? It seems to me she is a very meddlesome
old lady."</p>

<p>"She wants her nephew to marry Lady Adela. Every
one knows it. She invited her here just to throw them together
and make the match."</p>

<p>"But perhaps he will not marry her just to please his
aunt!" spiritedly.</p>

<p>"He will be apt to do just what my lady tells him,"
said Mrs. West. "If he does not, she will leave her
money away from him. He can not afford that."</p>

<p>"And will he really sell himself for money?" Leonora
spoke in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear; not quite so loud. As to selling himself,
I don't know that you could call it that exactly.
Many people here marry for wealth and position. Yet,
why shouldn't these two young people fall in love with
each other? Lady Adela has everything in the world that
is desirable, except money, and so has he. Their fortune
is made if they marry each other."</p>

<p>"Happy pair!" said Leonora, in a sarcastic voice, in
the darkness. "Isn't it just stifling in this hole, Aunt
West? Let us go."</p>

<p>They went back quietly to the little sitting-room again.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you enjoy it, Leonora?" asked her aunt.</p>

<p>"Oh! very much," said the girl.</p>

<p>"I'm glad. Somehow, I thought you didn't," vaguely.
"They are going to dance this evening. I can manage
for you to see it, if you like to do so. Should you, Leonora?"</p>

<p>"Oh! very much," said the girl again.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>It was a beautiful night, bright with moonlight and
starlight, and sweet with balmy air and the breath of fragrant
flowers. Leonora sat at the window and silently
drank in the sweet influences of the balmy night. She
would have liked to go out, but she did not suggest it, for
fear of shocking her aunt.</p>

<p>"Are there any old ruins about here, Aunt West, and
any pretty scenery?" she inquired, presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there are the old Abbey ruins, about two miles
from here. They are very pretty and picturesque. Artists
go there to sketch, and picnic parties to frolic. Devonshire
is a very pretty place, anyhow. A great many people
come here to make pictures."</p>

<p>"So I have heard," said Leonora. "May I go there
some day&mdash;to the Abbey, I mean&mdash;and make a picture,
Aunt West?"</p>

<p>"You, child? Can you sketch?"</p>

<p>"A little," demurely. "Indeed I have some talent for
it. I have drawn some little things good enough to sell."</p>

<p>"Can you, really?" cried the housekeeper, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Leonora, smiling. "To-morrow
I will unpack my trunks and show you some pictures I
did last year&mdash;some in California, some in New York
State, some in Virginia, and some in West Virginia."</p>

<p>"All those places?" said Mrs. West. "Why, my dear,
you must have traveled a great deal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have," Leonora answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>"But could poor Dick&mdash;could your papa afford it?"
inquired Mrs. West, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;whenever he found a large gold nugget&mdash;he
could," said Leonora. "We always had a little trip
somewhere then. Papa was very fond of traveling."</p>

<p>"It must have cost a great deal of money, and&mdash;weren't
you afraid, my dear? I have heard&mdash;at least I have read&mdash;that
there are many Indians in Virginia."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear aunt!" cried Leonora, amazed at such
lamentable ignorance; then, in a moment, she added,
kindly: "That was a great many years ago, aunt&mdash;when
Christopher Columbus discovered America. There are
not any Indians there now."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. West, relieved, and with a sudden
overwhelming feeling of dense ignorance, which Leonora
saw so plainly that she turned the conversation kindly
back to its first channel.</p>

<p>"But you haven't told me yet, aunt, if I may go and
sketch the Abbey ruins. I suppose they are out of Lady
Lancaster's jurisdiction," disdainfully.</p>

<p>"They are not, child, for they belong to Lord Lancaster;
but I don't think there can be any objection. She
never goes there herself," said Mrs. West.</p>

<p>"Then I shall go there some day and get a picture.
Perhaps it may be good enough to sell. I'm going to try
to help support myself, Aunt West."</p>

<p>"You need not, my dear, for I have savings enough for
us both, and you are welcome to your share," said the
good soul, kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not touch a penny. I shall sell pictures enough
to buy my dresses," said Leonora, with a confident air.</p>

<p>"They will have to be very good ones, dear," dubiously.</p>

<p>"I shall try to make them so," laughing.</p>

<p>At that moment a burst of music swelled upon the air&mdash;one
of Strauss's most intoxicating waltzes. Leonora's
heart thrilled to the sound.</p>

<p>"How delicious!" she cried.</p>

<p>"It is the band. The dance has begun," cried Mrs.
West. "Come, Leonora, you shall have a peep at it."</p>

<p>"Not from the shelter of another hot china-closet, I
hope," said the girl, laughing. "I am afraid of the cobwebs
and the spiders."</p>

<p>"We will find a better place this time. Put something
over your head, Leonora; we shall have to go out-doors,
and the dew is heavy."</p>

<p>Leonora wound a dark veil turban fashion about her head.</p>

<p>"Now?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, that will do; come on," Mrs. West replied.</p>

<p>They went on a little balcony shrouded in vines, from
which they could peep unobserved through an undraped
window into the brightly lighted ball-room.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this will not do any better than the china-closet,
after all," said Mrs. West, dubiously. "These
vines are so thick, there may be bugs and spiders in them,
too."</p>

<p>Leonora, shuddering, exclaimed, "Ugh! I can feel
them creeping now!" and then declared that she would
stay ten minutes, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it a pretty sight? Did you ever see anything so
pretty, my love?" exclaimed Mrs. West, proudly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>It was a pretty scene. The long ball-room was draped
in roseate colors and decorated with flowers. The walls
were exquisitely painted in appropriate figures, and the
waxed oaken floor shone so bright that it reflected the flying
figures of the men and women who whirled around it
in the sensuous measures of the gay waltz.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything so pretty?" repeated Mrs.
West, with a certain pride in this grand old family whom
she served; and her niece answered, unperturbably:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You have? Where?" whispered the good soul, incredulously.</p>

<p>"In New York," replied the girl. "I was at a ball
there last winter. It was very grand&mdash;much grander than
this."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she continued to gaze with a great deal of
interest at the animated scene. There were more than a
dozen couples upon the floor, the beautiful, richly dressed
women and black-coated men showing to their greatest
advantage in the gay dance. Leonora saw Lord Lancaster's
tall, splendid figure among them. He had Lady
Adela Eastwood for a partner. His arm was clasped
lightly about her tall, slender form; her dark, brilliant face
drooped toward his shoulder with rather a languishing air.</p>

<p>"Lady Adela is Lord Lancaster's partner," whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the housekeeper. "Aren't they a well-matched pair?
He is so fair, she is so dark, they go well together."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Leonora. She watched the two
figures admiringly, and thought how exquisitely the light
of the lamps shone down on Lady Adela's ruby silk and
her flashing diamonds. The black hair bound into a
braided coronet on the top of the graceful head contrasted
well with the fair locks that crowned Lord Lancaster's
brow.</p>

<p>"Yes, they go well together," she said to herself.
"Will expediency and inclination go hand in hand? Will
he marry her?"</p>

<p>"Lady Adela has superb diamonds," said the housekeeper,
in her shrill whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are very nice," said Leonora. "But I have&mdash;a
friend who has much finer ones. Her father gave
them to her for a birthday present. They cost fifty thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"What an odd girl! She is not one bit astonished at
the splendor of anything she sees. She has seen a great
deal of the world, really, and America must be a much
finer place than I ever thought it," mused Mrs. West to
herself.</p>

<p>"There, the waltz is over, Aunt West," whispered the
girl, clinging to her arm. "Hadn't we better go now?
Some one may come out here."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you have seen enough&mdash;have you?" Mrs. West
replied, and Leonora answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, quite enough, thank you. I do not like to look
at such gayety, and my dear papa so lately dead. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Aunt West, please let us walk out in the air awhile. It is
so warm here, and these vines are full of spiders and cobwebs,
just like that china-closet."</p>

<p>When Leonora West said "please" in that coaxing
tone there were not many people who could resist her.
Mrs. West did not. She said to herself that it would be no
harm to walk about the grounds a bit with her niece. She
could not refuse her a breath of fresh air, certainly.</p>

<p>She saw Lady Lancaster sitting in a chair in the ball-room,
and she did not think it likely that she would stir
from her seat for at least an hour.</p>

<p>"So I'll run the risk," said the kind-hearted woman.
"Come along, Leonora."</p>

<p>They went down into the beautiful grounds, along the
moonlighted paths, past gleaming groups of statuary,
ghost-like in the weird light, past beds of rarest flowers,
past thickets of roses, walls of honeysuckles, with the
white radiance of the moon shining over everything.</p>

<p>"How sweet this is!" the girl whispered. "When we
were crossing the ocean, I grew so tired of the water and
the sky; I longed for the green grass and the flowers.
How soft and fragrant the air is, and how beautiful the
moonlight! I think I could stay out here all night."</p>

<p>"You would catch your death of cold," Mrs. West said,
aghast. "The dews are very heavy."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I don't mean to; but it is so romantic.
It is like an Eastern night, so soft and balmy, and&mdash;oh,
oh! Aunt West, is that the nightingale&mdash;the English
nightingale papa used to love so dearly?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>She clapped her little hands. It was the nightingale, indeed,
hid in some flowery covert, all alone,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Pouring his full heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In profuse strains of unpremeditated art."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, it is the nightingale," said Mrs. West, delighted
that Leonora had found something at last in England to
grow enthusiastic over. "There are so many of them
here, and it is down by the Magic Mirror you hear that
one singing. It is their favorite resort."</p>

<p>"The Magic Mirror?" echoed Leonora.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is a pretty pond of water a little further on,
all fringed with willows and roses. It is as smooth and
clear as a mirror, and there is an old tradition that the
youth or maiden gazing into the Magic Mirror by moon
light, in the month of June, may see there reflected the
face of his or her life companion."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt West, let us go there!" cried the girl,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"What! you don't believe in that silly tradition?"
laughed the good woman.</p>

<p>"No, no, but to hear the nightingales," cried Leonora.
"Is it far, auntie?"</p>

<p>"No; only a short distance further on, at a little bend
where two paths meet. But we have come so far
already&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you are tired," said the girl, with generous compunction.
"I ought to have remembered that." She
pushed Mrs. West gently into a low rustic seat by the
path, and said, kindly: "Sit here and rest while I go find
it myself. The nightingale's voice shall guide me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will not be long?" said Mrs. West, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"No, no. May I go, Aunt West? Will you wait for
me here?" pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the kind, indulgent soul; and Leonora
set off at a quick pace, following the sound of the nightingale's
voice, and repeating under her breath those exquisite
lines to the nightingale written by Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beautiful nightingale, who shall portray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the varying turns of thy flowing lay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where is the lyre whose chords shall reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the notes of thy changeful melody?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may linger, indeed, and listen to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the linkéd chain of thy harmony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not for mortal hands to unbind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the clew of thy mazy music to find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy home is the wood on the echoing hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the verdant banks of the forest rill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft as the south wind the branches among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy plaintive lament goes floating along."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She went on swiftly through the beautiful night, guided
by the nightingale's voice, and with a fast-beating heart;
for, with all a young girl's folly, she meant to look into
the Magic Mirror to see, perchance, the face of her future
lord and master.</p>

<p>Louder and nearer grew the notes of the nightingale, as
Leonora hastened on. She thought she had never heard
anything so sweet. At first it had only been one bird, but
now several had joined their notes together in a medley of
intoxicating music that swelled deliciously upon the fragrant
air of the night. She walked lightly, almost holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
her breath as she came upon the scene, for fear of
frightening them away.</p>

<p>She passed from the shadow of the grand oaks that had
overhung her path, out into an open space, and the Magic
Mirror burst upon her sight&mdash;a little limpid lake fringed
with willows and sweet-brier and water-lilies, and so clear
that the full, white radiance of the moon and stars was
mirrored on its tranquil breast, while, hid in the thicket of
rose and willow, the night birds were pouring out their
hearts in song.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet!" cried the girl. She clasped her
hands in an ecstasy. Her heart was touched by the peaceful
beauty and enchanting repose of the scene. Scarce a
ripple stirred the bosom of the quiet lake, and the water-lilies,
drooping to look at their fair reflections, were
scarcely ruffled by the soft, light breeze that played
around the enchanting spot.</p>

<p>Leonora moved softly forward to the verge of the Magic
Mirror, and bending forward, with a slightly quickened
heart-beat, gazed down into its crystal-clear depths. She
saw her own face gazing back at her with all its fresh
young beauty, its eager eyes and parted lips, the dark veil
twisted carelessly about her head, and the loose tresses of
her hair flowing beneath it. She saw all this clearly as in
a mirror, and for a moment she remained intently gazing
at it, wondering if the old legend were indeed true, and if
the face of her future husband would indeed rise from
those mysterious depths by the side of her own.</p>

<p>So absorbed was she in contemplation that she did not
detect the faint scent of cigar smoke that suddenly filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the air; she did not hear the approaching step that was
muffled also, not to frighten the birds away. She remained
gazing intently into the water, half bent forward, her
hand grasping the slender branch of a willow, until suddenly,
in the mystic pool, a face looked over her shoulder&mdash;the
face of her fate.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Something like a startled cry burst from Leonora's
lips as she thus beheld that face beside her own&mdash;that
fair, strong, handsome face that was as familiar as her
own&mdash;the face of Clive, Lord Lancaster.</p>

<p>She believed for a moment that his face had indeed
arisen from the depths of the enchanted pool, and after
that one startled cry she was silent, watching it with dilated
eyes and bated breath, expecting every moment to see
it fade into the nothingness from which it had sprung.</p>

<p>But, instead of fading, it grew clearer to her sight; it
changed its expression. At first it had a half-mischievous
smile upon the lips and in the eyes; this changed to
gravity, tenderness, and passion. It was the face of a
lover on which Leonora now gazed with rapt interest, unconscious
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His eyes looked love<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To eyes that spake again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a moment of silent happiness.</p>

<p>The light wind stirred the lily-buds on the bosom of the
lake that held those two fair faces mirrored in its breast;
the nightingale's song pierced their hearts with exquisite
pleasure that bordered on pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Leonora, wandering for one moment in the Land of
Enchantment, was recalled to the present and to the actual
by the man's folly.</p>

<p>He should have stolen away as he had come, in silence,
leaving her alone with her beautiful, strange illusion, to
bear its fruit in due season; but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Love's presence, warm and near."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He yielded to a tender impulse without trying to resist
it. He was close beside her; his cheek was near her own;
his eyes looked into her eyes as they gazed up from the
water, and those soft orbs had a look in them that made
him dizzy with delight. He slid his arms around the
graceful bending form and whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Leonora, is it fate?"</p>

<p>Alas!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A touch, a kiss! the charm was snapt!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Like one startled from a dream, she looked up and saw
him holding her in that strong clasp, gazing into her face
with a passion that frightened her. She tore herself from
his arms.</p>

<p>"How dared you? oh, how dared you?" she cried out,
indignantly.</p>

<p>Her angry words, her scornful glance, chilled the fire
that burned within him. He realized his folly. Why had
he touched her, frightened her, and so broken the spell of
enchantment that held her? She would never forgive
him, perhaps, for his temerity.</p>

<p>"Did you think, because you were my Lord Lancaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
forsooth, and I only the housekeeper's niece, that you
could insult me thus?"</p>

<p>Her voice broke cold and sharp on the stillness. The
nightingales had all flown away at the first sound of her
angry tones.</p>

<p>"Insult you?" cried the culprit, agitatedly; he was too
much shocked at the result of his hasty act to speak calmer.
"Believe me, Miss West, I meant no insult. I did
not think that you would take it so."</p>

<p>His words were unfortunate. They irritated Leonora
even more.</p>

<p>"You did not think so?" she cried, gazing reproachfully
at him. "And, pray, sir, what cause had I given
you to&mdash;to think that your caresses could be agreeable to
me?"</p>

<p>He stood gazing at her in silence.</p>

<p>If he told her the real truth&mdash;told her that the face in
the Magic Mirror had fooled him with its soft eyes and tender
lips, and led him on to the commission of that impulsive
act&mdash;she would be more angry than ever. She would
deny that her own looks had tempted him, made a fool
of him. He would not stoop to exculpate himself from
the anger of one so manifestly unjust.</p>

<p>All the Lancaster pride flushed into his face as he stood
looking down at her from his haughty height, his arms
folded over his broad breast.</p>

<p>"What cause had I given you," she repeated, stamping
her little foot angrily on the earth, "to think that your
caresses were agreeable to me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is a little shrew!" he said to himself, with sudden
anger. "I will never give another thought to her."</p>

<p>With that thought he answered, coldly:</p>

<p>"If you were like other women, Miss West, I might exculpate
myself in your eyes. But as it is, I can only say
that I meant no harm, and I humbly crave your pardon."</p>

<p>"Like other women!" she flashed, haughtily. "What
do you mean, Lord Lancaster? Does the misfortune of
my poverty and lowly birth place me beyond the pale of
your respectful consideration? Perhaps, were I Lady Adela
Eastwood it would be different."</p>

<p>"What the deuce does she know about the earl's
daughter?" he asked himself, in extreme astonishment;
but he answered, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, it would be different, Miss West. I
should not look into the Magic Mirror over Lady Adela's
shoulder, certainly; nor would I put my arm around her
waist, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not say another word, for she interrupted him,
glowing with angry beauty.</p>

<p>"So you acknowledge the truth to my very face. For
shame, Lord Lancaster! You throw discredit upon your
name of gentleman; you make me hate and despise you for
those words! No; I will never forgive you as long as I
live!" sobbed Leonora, bursting into angry tears; and then
she fled away from him in the moonlight, leaving him
standing like one dazed by the side of the Magic Mirror.</p>

<p>But it was only for a moment that he remained thus
motionless.</p>

<p>He thought apprehensively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was most unwise in Mrs. West to allow her niece to
go roaming about alone at this hour. Even upon my
grounds she may lose her way, or meet with some unpleasant
adventure. I will follow her at a safe distance,
and see that she gets back safely to the Hall."</p>

<p>He set out hurriedly, and, turning the bend in the road,
almost ran over two figures standing motionless under the
tall trees that bordered the lane&mdash;Mrs. West, with Leonora
sobbing in her arms.</p>

<p>The good woman, looking up, uttered a cry of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord Lancaster! I am so glad to see you," she
exclaimed. "I am so frightened. Something must have
happened to Leonora. You see how she's crying. Well,
she came out for a breath of fresh air, and then she wanted
to hear the nightingales at the Magic Mirror, and so I sat
down and waited for her; but she stayed so long, I went
to look for her; and there she came flying into my arms,
and crying like some hurt thing. Did you see anything or
any person, my lord?" anxiously.</p>

<p>He was intensely annoyed. The sight of Leonora sobbing
grievously in the woman's arms bitterly irritated him.</p>

<p>Why would she misjudge him so persistently? why misunderstand
him always?</p>

<p>He looked at the graceful black figure with its head
bowed on Mrs. West's plump shoulder, and said, curtly:</p>

<p>"Miss West is unnecessarily alarmed. She has seen no
one or nothing but myself. It was the sight of me that
alarmed her."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! I did not mean to tell her!" cried Leonora
through her sobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a note of warning in her voice; but in his
vexation he did not heed it.</p>

<p>Mrs. West was looking at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Of course, she would not have been frightened at the
sight of you, my lord!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;was not frightened at anything&mdash;I was only
angry," Leonora said, lifting her head at this moment,
and hushing her low sobs into silence. "He had no right,
Aunt West," she added, incoherently.</p>

<p>"No right!" echoed the good woman, looking from one
to the other in amazement. "Why, what has he done,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; only looked over my shoulder into the water&mdash;and&mdash;and
frightened me. Please don't think me silly,
Aunt West. I think I'm nervous to-night. Let us go,"
said the girl, without looking at the tall, handsome form
standing so near her.</p>

<p>"Let me come to-morrow and explain," he said, humbly,
coming nearer to her; but she turned her face resolutely
from him.</p>

<p>"No," she said, icily; "it is quite unnecessary. Come,
Aunt West."</p>

<p>She dragged the good woman away, and left him standing
there in the moonlight, with a settled shadow upon his
face.</p>

<p>"What a contretemps!" he said to himself, gloomily.
"Ah! how little I thought, when I came out to-night to
smoke that solitary cigar, that I should meet with such an
adventure! How angry she was! Every time we meet
we drift further away from each other!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>He went back to Lady Adela and his guests after awhile.
The earl's daughter chided him because he had left them
for that odious cigar.</p>

<p>"It was most ungallant!" she declared.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. I went to consult that oracle, the
Magic Mirror," he replied.</p>

<p>Lady Adela had heard the old legend. She smiled and
bridled.</p>

<p>"Did you see your fate?" she asked him; and he
answered, in a strange tone:</p>

<p>"I saw the woman I love in the Magic Mirror."</p>

<p>The earl's beautiful daughter was a little puzzled by his
reply. She wondered if hers was the face he had seen in
the water, but she dared not put the thought into words.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>Several days passed away very quietly after Leonora's
first day and night at Lancaster Park. The girl stayed in
the small rooms to which she was restricted quite as closely
as the housekeeper could have desired. She did not even
offer to go out, seeming to have tacitly resigned herself to
the situation.</p>

<p>She unpacked one of her trunks and showed Mrs. West
the sketches she had promised to show her; she took out
all her pretty, simple black dresses, and hung them on
their pegs in the little dressing-closet her aunt assigned her.</p>

<p>When she had nothing else to do she read or embroidered.
Her aunt noted with pleasure that she was seldom
idle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not know of the long hours Leonora spent, when
alone, curled up in a big easy-chair, with her milk-white
hands folded in her lap, her eyes half shut, with the dark
lashes drooping against the pink cheeks, and a thoughtful,
puzzled expression on the fair face.</p>

<p>If she had seen her, Mrs. West would have wondered
much what her niece was thinking about.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the gay life of the great folks at Lancaster
went on from day to day.</p>

<p>Leonora saw no more of it, steadily declining the well-meant
offers of her aunt to provide her with surreptitious
peeps at it.</p>

<p>"I do not care about it," Leonora would say, with an
eloquent glance at her black dress. "Gayety only jars
upon me, auntie, dear. I should like to go out in the
fresh air a little; but if I can not do that, I have no desire
for the rest."</p>

<p>But Mrs. West, however willing she was, did not dare
advise her niece to go out into the grounds where the
guests might be encountered at any time, or even old
Lady Lancaster herself.</p>

<p>She knew that Leonora's pretty face, once seen by the
guests, would excite remark. It had already won the admiration
of the house-maids.</p>

<p>These latter persons, having caught occasional glimpses
of Leonora in their errands to the housekeeper's room,
were disposed to be very sociable with the fair American
girl; but Mrs. West put an end to their well-meant cordialities
by saying, gently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"My niece would rather not be disturbed; she is in
great trouble; she has recently lost her father."</p>

<p>After that the maids did not court Leonora's society any
more. They accepted her aunt's excuse good-naturedly
and sympathetically, and contented themselves by talking
about her among themselves, and praising her beauty,
which they declared to each other was even greater than
that of the young ladies who were sojourning at Lancaster&mdash;greater
even than that of Lady Adela Eastwood, who, it
was confidently whispered, was to be the next mistress of
Lancaster Park.</p>

<p>Mrs. West grew downright sorry for her pretty prisoner,
whose pink cheeks were fading in the close, dark rooms
where she was kept. She said to herself that this would
not do. She must not have poor Dick's orphan child pining
for liberty and light and the blessed sunshine that was
free to all.</p>

<p>"I will not do it; no, not if I have to leave Lady Lancaster's
service and make a home for the girl elsewhere,"
she said to herself.</p>

<p>So one day she came into the little room where Leonora,
sitting at the window, gazed wistfully out at the green
grass and the blue sky, with an unconscious pathos on the
sweet, girlish face.</p>

<p>"My dear, you are tired of this stuffy little chamber, I
know," she said.</p>

<p>"Not very," said the girl, a little drearily. "I suppose
I ought to be grateful to you for giving me such a
home."</p>

<p>"Grateful to me for hiding you away in these little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
musty rooms, as if you hadn't the sweetest face the sun
ever shone on!" cried the good woman, self-reproachfully.
"Not a bit of it, my dear. I'm ashamed of myself for
treating you so. It mustn't go on so, or your health will
suffer, and so I shall tell Lady Lancaster; and if she won't
allow you the liberty of the grounds, I will go away from
here and make us a snug little home somewhere else,
where we may come and go as we please; so there!" said
the good woman, with sudden independence.</p>

<p>Leonora rose impulsively and went and kissed the
homely face of her friend.</p>

<p>"Aunt West, would you really do that much for me?"
she exclaimed, delightedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would," Mrs. West answered, firmly. "Poor
Dick left you to me to take care of, and I'm bound to do
the best I can for your happiness."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Leonora, checking an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"And I've come to tell you," Mrs. West continued,
"that if you'd like to go and sketch the Abbey ruins, you
may go this morning, Leonora."</p>

<p>"If I'd like!" cried the girl. "Oh, Aunt West! it's
just what I was wishing for. I shall be so happy!"</p>

<p>"Yes; you shall go, dear, and stay all day, if you like.
I'll put you up a nice cold lunch in a little basket, and
I'll hire the lodge-keeper's boy to show you the way. I'll
give him a shilling to go, and he will stay all day to keep
you from getting frightened."</p>

<p>"I shall not be frightened," said Leonora, radiant.</p>

<p>"I don't know; it's still and lonesome-like there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the bats and screech-owls might startle you. And there's
an old dismantled chapel, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely! I shall sketch that, too!" Leonora
exclaimed, clapping her bands like a gleeful child.</p>

<p>"And a little old grave-yard," pursued Mrs. West.
"Some of the old Lancasters are buried there. You
might be afraid of their ghosts."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of the Lancasters, dead or living,"
the girl answered, saucily, her spirits rising at the prospect
before her.</p>

<p>She set forth happily under the convoy of little Johnnie
Dale, the lodge-keeper's lad, a loquacious urchin who
plied her with small-talk while he walked by her side
with the lunch-basket Mrs. West had prepared with as
dainty care as if for Lady Lancaster herself.</p>

<p>She did not check the boy's happy volubility, although
she did not heed it very much, either, as they hurried
through the grand old park, where the brown-eyed deer
browsed on the velvety green grass, and the great oak-trees
cast shadows, perhaps a century old, across their path.</p>

<p>When they had shut the park gates behind them, and
struck into the green country lanes, bordered with honeysuckle
and lilac, Leonora drew breath with a sigh of delight.</p>

<p>"How sweet it all is! My father's country, too," she
said. "Ah! he was right to love these grand old English
homes, although he was but lowly born. What a grand
old park, what sweet, green lanes, what a sweet and peaceful
landscape! It is no wonder that the English love England!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>She remembered how her father, now dead and buried
under the beautiful American skies, had loved England,
and always intended to return to it some day with his
daughter, that she might behold his native land.</p>

<p>She remembered how often he had quoted Mrs. Hemans'
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The stately homes of England,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">How beautiful they stand!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Amidst their tall ancestral trees<br /></span>
<span class="i3">O'er all the pleasant land!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The deer across their greensward bound<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Through shade and sunny gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the swan glides past them with the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of some rejoicing stream."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"He loved the homes of England, although his fate was
not cast with them," she said to herself. "Poor papa! I
must try to love England for his sake; it was always dear
to him, although he was fond of his kind adopted home,
too!"</p>

<p>When they reached the ruins, she studied them carefully
on every side to secure a picturesque view. She found
that to get the best possible one she would have to sit
down among the graves close to the little dismantled
chapel.</p>

<p>"You bain't going to sit down amang them theer dead
folk, missus?" inquired Johnnie, round-eyed, and on the
alert for ghosts.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. Are you afraid to stay, Johnnie?" she
asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"Ya'as, I be," he replied, promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well; you may go off to a distance and play,"
said Leonora. "Don't let any one come this way to disturb
me. And if you get hungry, you may have a sandwich
out of my basket."</p>

<p>"I'm hungry now," he answered, greedily.</p>

<p>"Already, you little pig!" she cried. "Very well;
take your sandwich now, then, and be off out of my way.
I'm going to make a picture."</p>

<p>She sat down on the broken head-stone of an old grave,
took out her materials, and while she trimmed her pencils,
glanced down and read the name on the tomb beneath
her.</p>

<p>It was Clive, Lord Lancaster.</p>

<p>Something like a shudder passed over her as this dead
Lancaster, gone from the ways of men more than a century
ago, recalled to her the living one.</p>

<p>"What do all the paltry aims and ambitions of our life
matter, after all?" the girl asked herself, soberly. "The
grave awaits us all at last!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Await alike the inevitable hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The path of glory leads but to the grave.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sitting there among the lonely green graves and
broken, discolored monuments, with the ivy creeping over
their dim inscriptions, Leonora, a little lonely black figure,
began her sketch.</p>

<p>She worked industriously and skillfully, and nothing disturbed
her for several hours.</p>

<p>Johnnie had availed himself of the opportunity to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
an excursion into the woods on his own account, and she
was quite alone; but nothing alarmed her, and she worked
on fearlessly amid the fragrant stillness of the lovely June
day, whose calmness was broken by nothing louder than
the hum of the bees among the flowers, or the joyous carol
of the sky-lark as it soared from earth to heaven, losing
itself, as it were, in the illimitable blue of the sky.</p>

<p>The midday sun climbed high and higher into the sky,
and Leonora, pausing over her nearly completed sketch,
pushed back her wide hat from her flushed face, and
stopped to rest, glancing around at the quiet graves that
encompassed her.</p>

<p>"What a still and peaceful company we are!" she said,
aloud, quaintly, never thinking how strange it looked to
see her sitting there&mdash;the only living thing among the
silent tombs.</p>

<p>Then all at once, as if the tenants of the grave had come
to life, Leonora heard a soft babel of voices and laughter.</p>

<p>With a start she turned her head.</p>

<p>A party of gay young ladies and gentlemen were strolling
toward her across the level greensward. Foremost
among them was Lord Lancaster, walking beside the earl's
daughter.</p>

<p>It was too late for retreat.</p>

<p>Every eye turned on the graceful figure sitting there so
quietly among the graves of the dead and gone Lancasters.</p>

<p>As they passed the low stone wall that divided them,
Lancaster lifted his hat and bowed low and profoundly.</p>

<p>Then they were gone, but an eager hum of masculine
voices was borne back to her ears on the light breeze:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Jove! what a beauty!"</p>

<p>"Heavens! was that a ghost?"</p>

<p>"What a lovely being! Who is she, Lancaster?"
She heard his deep, musical voice answer carelessly:</p>

<p>"It is Miss West&mdash;a young lady who is staying in the
neighborhood for the sketching, I believe."</p>

<p>They went on toward the ruins.</p>

<p>Leonora, with a deeper color in her fair face, bent over
her sketch and rapidly put some finishing touches to it.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder where little Johnnie can be?" she
thought.</p>

<p>She glanced up and saw Captain Lancaster coming
back to her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>He came on quickly toward the figure sitting among the
graves, with the small head poised defiantly, although Leonora
was thinking to herself:</p>

<p>"He is coming to scold me, perhaps, for trespassing on
his property."</p>

<p>He came up to her and stood bareheaded before her
with the sunlight falling on his fair head&mdash;tall, stalwart,
handsome&mdash;a living Lancaster among those dead and gone
ones; one who did no discredit to the name.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for interrupting you," he said;
"but&mdash;you are sketching the ruins?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you let me see your work?"</p>

<p>She held it out to him in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>He scrutinized it in mingled wonder and delight.</p>

<p>"How perfect! how spirited! how beautiful!" he cried.
"You must have real talent!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" she answered, with a slight inclination
of her head.</p>

<p>He stood watching the half-averted face a moment in
silence. It had a slightly bored air, as if she wished he had
not come, or that he would, at least, soon go.</p>

<p>"You are very brave, Miss West, sitting here all alone
among these graves," he said, after that momentary pause.</p>

<p>"Did you leave your friends to come back and tell me
that?" inquired she, with delicate sarcasm.</p>

<p>"No-o," slowly; "I came back to ask a favor, Miss
West."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes; and it is this: I should like to have that sketch.
My friend, Lady Adela, is in raptures over that pile of old
ruins. She would like to have a picture of it."</p>

<p>He was watching her closely. He was rewarded for his
intent scrutiny by seeing an angry crimson flush the round
cheek.</p>

<p>"You would like this for her?" said Leonora, with
ominous calmness.</p>

<p>"Yes; will you part with it?&mdash;for money, if you will.
It is singularly perfect, and should be worth something
considerable."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Leonora.</p>

<p>She had pulled a flower from a grave, and was tearing
its petals apart with fierce cruelty between her white
fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I am only just," he said; then, with a smile.
"Ah! Miss West, do not be so cruel to that poor flower.
I have a shuddering conviction that it is, metaphorically,
myself you are deliberately annihilating."</p>

<p>She glanced up to him rather curiously from beneath her
shady lashes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;did not really think what I was doing," she said.
"Why should you think I would treat you that way?"</p>

<p>"Because I have been so unfortunate as to incur your
dislike," he answered.</p>

<p>She did not utter the denial he half hoped she would,
but she threw her mutilated flower from her with a
quickly suppressed sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, am I to have the sketch?" he inquired, after
waiting vainly for an answer.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You refuse?" he asked, chagrined.</p>

<p>"Yes. I drew the picture for myself, not for Lady
Adela," she replied, spiritedly.</p>

<p>"She will be disappointed at my failure to secure it for
her," said he.</p>

<p>"That does not matter to me," Leonora returned,
coldly. "Why does she not make a picture for herself?"</p>

<p>"She does not sketch."</p>

<p>"Ah! is it beneath her dignity?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"No, but beyond her power," he returned.</p>

<p>"Really?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "she assures me that she has no
talent at all in that way. You who are so clever, Miss
West, might afford to pity her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do, but not because she can not draw," said Leonora.</p>

<p>"Why, then?"</p>

<p>"Because, for all her high birth and proud position, she
will have to sell herself for money."</p>

<p>The shot told. She saw his cheek grow red.</p>

<p>"Mrs. West has been telling her these things. I wish
to Heaven she had held her tongue!" he thought, bitterly.
But aloud he said, lightly: "Perhaps you may find it expedient
to do the same thing, Miss West."</p>

<p>"To do what?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"To marry for money," he replied.</p>

<p>"And you think it would be expedient?" she inquired,
drawing her delicate black brows together in a vexed little
frown.</p>

<p>"Yes, for you," he replied. "You are too beautiful and
gifted, Miss West, to be contented in your present humble
condition. You should marry wealth and position. Both
would become you rarely."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord," she said, bowing, with a pretty
gesture of mock humility.</p>

<p>"That reminds me to tell you that De Vere will be here
to-morrow," he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>"What has that to do with our subject?" she inquired,
shortly.</p>

<p>"Everything. De Vere is in love with you, and he is
rich and well born. You can be Mrs. De Vere any time
you wish."</p>

<p>"Did your friend employ you to tell me this?" asked
Leonora, pale with passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; but he would have no objection to my doing so.
He will tell you so himself when he comes."</p>

<p>"And you advise me to marry him?" she asked, gazing
into his face with her soft, steady glance.</p>

<p>His own eyes fell beneath it.</p>

<p>"I should not presume to advise you; yet it would be a
good thing for you, I know. De Vere adores you. He
would be your slave, and you would be like a little queen
in the position to which his wealth would raise you."</p>

<p>"You make a great deal of wealth," she said, gravely,
and waiting curiously for his reply.</p>

<p>"It is a great power in the world," he replied.</p>

<p>"Is it?" she asked. "Ah! Lord Lancaster, 'almost
thou persuadest me' to sink to Lady Adela's level and sell
myself for gold."</p>

<p>"You seem to have imbibed a strange contempt for
Lady Adela," he said.</p>

<p>"I have. Where is her womanliness, her self-respect,
that she can lend herself to that wicked old woman's ambitious
schemes for buying a coroneted head with her
twenty thousand a year? She is the daughter of a hundred
earls, and yet she can give herself to you merely for
the money's sake. Pah!"</p>

<p>"Need it be merely for the money's sake?" he asked.
"Am I repulsive to look upon, Miss West? Is it quite
impossible that a woman, Lady Adela or another, should
give me her heart with her hand?"</p>

<p>Something like wounded pride quivered in his voice, and
he looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Would it be impossible for me to be loved for myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
alone?" he went on, slowly. "Might not some good,
true, sweet woman love me for my own self&mdash;even as I
am?"</p>

<p>She looked up at the handsome face, the large, graceful
form, and silently recalled the words Lieutenant De Vere
had spoken to her on the steamer's deck that day:</p>

<p>"He is more run after by the women than any man in
the regiment."</p>

<p>"He knows his power," she thought; and from sheer
contrariness made no answer to his appeal. "He shall
not know what I think about it," she said to herself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>The handsome young lord stood looking at the fair face
and mute red lips with a half chagrined air for a moment;
then he said, hastily:</p>

<p>"Good-day, Miss West. I see how disagreeable my presence
is, so I will leave you to your meditations among the
tombs. I hope none of those old fellows will come out of
their graves to haunt you for your scorn of their descendant.</p>

<p>"I hope not, indeed!" said Leonora, and then she
laughed.</p>

<p>He turned back at the sound of that laugh.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was relenting.</p>

<p>She had risen, indeed, and was holding out to him the
sketch he coveted.</p>

<p>"Take it," she said. "I was in a bad temper just
now. Lady Adela may have it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you, indeed, be so kind?" he exclaimed, radiant
with pleasure. "But, indeed, you must not give your
whole morning's work for nothing. Let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put his hand into his pocket and brought out a shining
gold piece.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord," said Leonora, demurely, as she
received the money into her palm. "I shall be able to
buy myself a new dress with this."</p>

<p>"You are not angry?" he said, struck by an inexplicable
something in her tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I am very glad to be so well paid for my
work," she answered, with the same demure air; and then
she said, suddenly: "Good-morning," and walked away
from him.</p>

<p>He followed her.</p>

<p>"Are you going home alone, Miss West?"</p>

<p>"No; I have a small escort hereabouts, if he has not
eaten my lunch and run away," she replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Johnnie Dale? No, he has not run away. You will
find him in the lane, where I saw him as we came through.
Shall I find him for you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. Doubtless Lady Adela is impatient at
your long stay," she said, walking coolly away from him.</p>

<p>"The deuce! I expect she is. I had quite forgotten
the daughter of a hundred earls," he said to himself, ruefully.
"I forget everything with Leonora West. She
would not answer my question, yet I would give the world
to know what she really thinks. If I had not promised
De Vere a fair field, I would try to find out what she
thought before the sun sets. How brusque she is! Ah!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The last exclamation was wrung from him by seeing
Leonora lift her hand as she walked across the field.</p>

<p>Something bright and shining flashed in the air a moment,
then fell into the grass.</p>

<p>"She has thrown my gold piece away like so much
dross! What does she mean?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>But the question was one not easily answered, so he returned
to his friends, who were chattering like so many
magpies among the ruins.</p>

<p>"We thought you had gone back home, you were so
long away," said Lady Adela, looking rather cross.</p>

<p>"Now I shall have to invent some fiction to account for
my long absence," he thought, pulling vexedly at his long
mustache. "Deuce take the women! They pull one this
way and that way, until one is out of patience!"</p>

<p>And while he was hastily concocting an excuse, Leonora
was walking rapidly through the lanes and fields with little
Johnnie, on her way back to the Hall.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came back so soon," Mrs. West said;
"for some of the young people have gone over to the
ruins, I hear, and I was afraid they would see you."</p>

<p>"They did see me; but I came away soon after," the
girl answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>"They are going to have a picnic at the ruins to-morrow,
it seems," pursued her aunt. "Lady Lancaster
and all of them are going. So the house will be empty,
and I can take you all over it to-morrow, if you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I shall like it very much," said Leonora,
rather apathetically.</p>

<p>"And your picture of the ruins&mdash;did you get it, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
dear?" pursued Mrs. West, suddenly remembering the
sketch.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I finished it."</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to let me see it?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, aunt, but I sold it as soon as I finished it.
I'll go back some day and make another for you."</p>

<p>"You sold it! To whom, my dear?" exclaimed the
good soul, surprised.</p>

<p>"Why, to Lord Lancaster," Leonora answered, indifferently.</p>

<p>But Mrs. West was delighted. She thought that her
niece must be very accomplished, indeed, if she could
make a picture that Lord Lancaster would be willing to
buy.</p>

<p>"He was very kind, especially after the way she behaved
the other night. It was quite silly. I did not
think Leonora would be so easily frightened. It is a wonder
that Lord Lancaster was not offended," she thought.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>The next day dawned as fair and lovely as any picnic-party
could desire. The party from Lancaster set out as
early as twelve o'clock, and left the coast clear for Leonora's
explorations of the great house.</p>

<p>Mrs. West, with her basket full of keys upon her arm,
undertook the office of guide. We do not propose to accompany
them, you and I, reader. Descriptions of rooms
are wearisome alike to reader and writer. Most people
skip over these prolix inventories of furniture and bric-a-brac,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and hasten on to more interesting matters. We will
too, reader.</p>

<p>Mrs. West had "reckoned without her host" when she
supposed that the house was empty, and that the lady of
Lancaster Park as well as the rest of the guests had gone
to the Abbey ruins on fun and frolic intent. It was quite
true that she had intended doing so, but there is a quaint
old adage to the effect that "man proposes, but God disposes."</p>

<p>That prosaic affliction, rheumatism, which is no respecter
of persons, and to which old age is peculiarly
liable, laid its grim hand upon the great lady that morning,
and reminded her of a fact that she was sometimes
prone to forget, in the arrogance of her greatness and
worldly prosperity&mdash;namely that, in spite of her wealth and
power, she was but mortal, after all, and that although she
could order other things, she had no control over her own
frail body and soul.</p>

<p>So, groaning under the hand of her relentless enemy,
Lady Lancaster was fain to relinquish her design of superintending
the loves of her nephew and the earl's daughter
for that day at least. She made arrangements for the
party to proceed without her, and surrendered herself to
the good offices of her maid for the day.</p>

<p>And a doleful day Mlle. Elise had of it, too, for her
lady's temper, never sweet, was sharp as vinegar under the
stress of her affliction. In vain did Elise apply the hot
fomentations and the vaunted liniments, in vain darken
the room, and with kindest ministrations endeavor to woo
quiet and repose to the couch of the afflicted one. Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Lancaster being full of selfishness and venom always,
vented it with even more than usual rigor upon the head
of her unoffending handmaid, and keeping up a series of
groans, hysterics, and revilings, made hideous the gloom
of her curtained chamber.</p>

<p>So, groaning and lamenting and scolding, Lady Lancaster
passed the hours of her penance, and toward high
noon the devoted maid had the satisfaction of hearing her
acknowledge that she felt a little better, and that if the
sharp twinges of pain did not come back into her shoulder,
she might perhaps fall into a little doze.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said Elise, devoutly, to herself, and she
smoothed and patted the lace-fringed pillows, and sat
down to watch her mistress's slumbers, feeling intensely
relieved, and praying within herself that the shrewish dowager
might not open her keen black eyes again for at least
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"For I do not believe that her shoulder can hurt any
worse than mine, with the rubbing I have given her," said
the French woman, ruefully, to herself; and she was afraid
to breathe lest those wrinkled lids should open again, and
the querulous voice demand some further service from her
weary and impatient handmaiden.</p>

<p>"And if the pay wasn't so good, I would not stay in her
service another day," said the woman to herself. "She
grows harder and more vixenish every day of her life. As
old as she is, she does not seem to be making any preparations
for dying. I dare say she expects to live forever.
Ugh! how yellow, and wrinkled, and ugly she is, with the
paint and powder off, and her wig of gray curls in the box;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
I should want to die if I were as ugly and witchy-looking
as she is."</p>

<p>And the maid settled her coquettish little cap a little
more rakishly upon her befrizzled hair, and made a grimace
expressive of intense satisfaction with her own young
and pretty face. For Elise, in common with many of her
sex, believed that beauty was a great power in the world,
and had vague dreams of making capital out of hers as
soon as she had saved up a little pile of money, enough to
start a thread and needle and ribbon shop for herself in
London, where she expected to captivate some handsome
and flourishing young tradesman with her pretty face and
gay attire.</p>

<p>But while Elise, gazing into the long mirror opposite,
indulged in these Alnaschar visions of the future, the
beady black orbs of her mistress had flared wide open
again, and she exclaimed, in such sharp, sudden accents
that the maid gave a start of terror:</p>

<p>"Elise, who is that playing upon the drawing-room
piano?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, I thought you were asleep!" cried poor
Elise, ruefully.</p>

<p>"So I should have been if some fool had not commenced
to play on the grand piano in the drawing-room. Who is
it, I say?" demanded Lady Lancaster, irascibly.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, you must be mistaken!" Elise began to
say; but then she stopped in confusion. Some one <i>was</i>
playing the piano, and the strong, full, melodious notes,
struck by a practiced hand, echoed melodiously through
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not deaf, Mam'selle Elise," said her mistress,
scornfully. "Some one is playing the piano. Hark, it is
the grand march from 'Norma!' I thought all of the
people had gone to the picnic."</p>

<p>"So they have, my lady&mdash;every soul of them."</p>

<p>"Then who is that playing in the drawing-room?&mdash;tell
me that!" snapped the peevish old lady.</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't know, Lady Lancaster," answered the
maid, truthfully.</p>

<p>"Then make it your business to find out&mdash;go and see,"
was the peremptory command; and Elise without any more
ado obeyed it.</p>

<p>"I did not know that there was a woman in the house
who could wake the soul in the piano like that," said Lady
Lancaster to herself, when the girl was gone. "What a
touch! What grand notes! Who is it that has been hiding
her talents in a napkin? Not Lady Adela! She is
fast enough to show all the accomplishments she possesses.
So are all the other women, for that matter. Modesty is
not one of their failings."</p>

<p>And she waited most impatiently for Elise to return.
She was both curious and angry. She was angry because
her nap had been brought to an untimely end, and she was
curious to know who had done it.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the maid stayed a long time. The
march from "Norma" was finished, and the unknown
musician had struck into another piece&mdash;a melancholy
fugue&mdash;before the girl came flying back with upraised
hands and dilated eyes, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, I never was so astonished in all my life!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>"You fool!" cried Lady Lancaster, in a rage. "Who
cares whether you are astonished or not? Why don't you
tell me what I sent you to find out?"</p>

<p>"What a spiteful old cat!" Elise said to herself, indignantly;
but she answered, meekly enough:</p>

<p>"So I am going to tell you, my lady, directly. It's
that girl from America&mdash;the housekeeper's niece."</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster bounded erect in her bed and regarded
the maid for a moment in unfeigned dismay. She had
utterly forgotten the existence of Mrs. West's niece, and it
took several minutes of bewildered thought to recall her
to her mind. When her memory had fully come back, she
gasped out feebly:</p>

<p>"Do you say that that child&mdash;West's niece&mdash;is down in
the drawing-room playing on the piano?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady, that was what I said," said Elise, who
was almost as much astonished as her mistress.</p>

<p>"The impertinent little monkey! Wherever did she
learn to play like that? Did you tell her to go away,
Elise?" angrily.</p>

<p>"No, my lady. I only went and peeped in at the door.
When I saw who it was, I came quietly away."</p>

<p>"Help me out of bed, Elise," cried her mistress, imperiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, and bring back all the pain in your
shoulder again!" Elise cried, aghast.</p>

<p>"Do as I bid you, girl," sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The maid took the thin, bony little figure into her
strong young arms, and lifted it out upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Now bring my dressing-gown, my slippers, and my
wig. Put them on me&mdash;quickly," commanded my lady.</p>

<p>Elise knew that there was no use in expostulating. She
quietly did as she was told. She powdered the yellow face,
adjusted the curly wig and youthful cap, put on the velvet
slippers and the gorgeous brocaded dressing-gown that
made Lady Lancaster look like the Queen of Sheba in all
her glory.</p>

<p>"Now give me your arm," she said, turning toward the
door.</p>

<p>"But, my lady, where are you going?" cried Elise.</p>

<p>"To the drawing-room," curtly.</p>

<p>"You'll catch your death of cold," whimpered the
maid.</p>

<p>"What is that to you?" flashed the dowager, sharply.
"Come along."</p>

<p>And clinging to the arm of Elise, and groaning at every
step with the reawakened pain in her shoulder, Lady Lancaster
took up her march to the drawing-room, her flowered
gown trailing majestically behind her, going forth as
one goes to conquer, for she was intent on the instant and
utter annihilation, metaphorically speaking, of the daring
plebeian child who had so coolly transgressed her commands.</p>

<p>Leonora had never got beyond the picture-gallery and
the drawing-room. The great, black, ebony piano had
fascinated her. She could not tear herself away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt West, my fingers ache to touch the keys!"</p>

<p>"Can you play, dear?" asked her aunt, with one of her
kind, indulgent smiles.</p>

<p>"Only let me show you," said the girl. "There is no
one to hear, is there, aunt?"</p>

<p>"No, there is no one," said Mrs. West, reflectively.
"The maids are all in the other wing. This part of the
house is empty. I dare say it will be no harm for you to
amuse yourself a little while."</p>

<p>She threw back the magnificent embroidered cover, and
raised the lid herself. Leonora's eyes beamed under their
long lashes at sight of the gleaming pearl keys.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, under her breath, and sat down. She
ran her fingers lightly along the keys. A shower of
melody seemed to fall from them. The silver-sweet notes
fell soft and swift as rain-drops from the flying fingers,
and full of subtle harmony and delicious sound. She
played on and on, and when the exquisite aria came to a
close Mrs. West gazed at her in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, what music!" she cried. "I do not believe
that any of the ladies who come here can play as well
as that."</p>

<p>"Can not Lady Adela?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sure she can not," Mrs. West answered, decidedly.
"But shall we go now?"</p>

<p>"Presently, Aunt West. I may stay just a little longer,
may I not?"</p>

<p>"If you like to stay alone. I have just thought of some
duties I have to perform. I will go back and leave you
here. If I come in half an hour, will you be ready?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you, aunt," she answered, and ran her
fingers lovingly over the keys, little thinking that the
strong, full, joyous notes were awakening Nemesis from
her nap upstairs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>While Lady Lancaster was finishing her toilet upstairs,
Leonora finished her fugue in the drawing-room. Then
she played a little <i>morceau</i> from Bach. Then she began
to sing. The dowager, coming along the corridor outside
with stealthy, cat-like steps, was amazed to catch the passionate
words of a little gem from "Iolanthe," sung in a
voice as sweet and clear and well trained as many a professional
could boast.</p>

<p>"An opera song! Upon my word! What sort of a girl
is it, anyhow?" ejaculated the dowager, in astonishment;
and in spite of her haste and anger, she could not help
pausing to hear the words of the tender love song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"None shall part us from each other,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">All in all to each are we;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All in all to one another,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I to thee, and thou to me!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou the tree, and I the flower&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou the idol, I the throng&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou the day, and I the hour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou the singer, I the song!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou the stream, and I the willow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou the sculptor, I the clay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou the ocean, I the billow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou the sunrise, I the day!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>"Upon my word, that must be a remarkable child,"
Lady Lancaster said to herself; and, like Elise, she peeped
around the door to get a secret view of the daring transgressor.</p>

<p>After she had looked she stepped back a pace in amazement.
She was more astonished than she had ever been
in her life.</p>

<p>The child she had come to see was nowhere. She had
come down the stairs with a distinct intention of "boxing
the little brat's ears for her temerity." She stared in
amazement at what she saw.</p>

<p>And yet it was not a wonderful sight, but only a very
pleasing one&mdash;unless my lady had been hard to please&mdash;only
a graceful, girlish figure in deep black, with a line of
white at the slender throat, where the narrow linen collar
was fastened with a neat bar of jet&mdash;only a fair young
face, with its profile turned toward the door, and two
small white hands guiltless of rings or other adorning, save
their own dimpled beauty, straying over the keys with a
loving touch, as if all her soul was in her song.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster caught her breath with a gasp as if someone
had thrown cold water over her. She turned to the
maid; exclaiming, in a shrill whisper:</p>

<p>"Elise, that is not West's American niece. You are
trying to deceive me!"</p>

<p>"No, my lady, I am not. It is Miss West. Is she not
a pretty girl?"</p>

<p>"But I thought," said my lady, ignoring the question,
"that West's niece was a child. I am sure she told me
so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know what she told you; but this is certainly
Leonora West," reiterated the maid; and then her mistress
stepped over the threshold into the room, the long train of
her stiff brocade rustling behind her as she walked with an
air of withering majesty upon her wrinkled face.</p>

<p>Leonora, hearing the ominous sound, glanced around
with a startled air, her hands fell from the keys, and she
sprung to her feet, and stood waiting the lady's approach&mdash;not
humbly, not nervously, but with that calm dignity
and self-possession that seemed characteristic of her, and
that seemed to belong peculiarly to her as fragrance belongs
to a flower.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster was not propitiated by that peculiar air.
To her angry eyes it savored of defiance.</p>

<p>She walked on across the thick, soft pile of the velvet
carpet until she was directly in front of the waiting girl,
and then Leonora lifted her eyes with an air of gentle curiosity,
and dropped her a graceful courtesy.</p>

<p>"Impertinent! I have a great mind to slap her, anyhow!"
the old lady said, irately, to herself; but she kept
down her spleen with a great effort of will, and said, with
ironical politeness:</p>

<p>"You are Leonora West, the housekeeper's niece, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, that is my name," Leonora answered,
with another graceful bow. "And you are&mdash;Mrs. Lancaster!"</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster, if you please," flashed the dowager,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Ah?" smoothly. "Lady Lancaster, I beg your pardon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
You see we have no titles in America. A plain
Mrs. is a title of honor in itself, and when one comes to
England one is apt to forget the requirements of rank."</p>

<p>A graceful, simple explanation enough; but Elise, who
kept close beside her mistress, saw a roguish gleam in the
blue-gray eyes shaded by the drooping black lashes.</p>

<p>"She is laughing in her sleeve at my lady," thought
the astute maid; but she did not resent the girlish impertinence
in her mind. Lady Lancaster snubbed her handmaid
so often that Elise rather enjoyed seeing her snubbed
in her turn.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster dimly felt something in the suave, silver-sweet
tones that vaguely angered her.</p>

<p>"You are very excusable, Miss West," she said, tartly
and insultingly. "One has to pardon much to American
impudence and ignorance."</p>

<p>Leonora looked at her with the full gaze of her clear
orbs.</p>

<p>"I hardly think I understand you, Lady Lancaster,"
said she, calmly.</p>

<p>"I fail to make my meaning clear, do I?" cried the
dowager, furious. "Tell me this, then. How dared you
come into my drawing-room and play on the piano?"</p>

<p>"Your drawing-room?" the girl lifted her eyes in
gentle, courteous inquiry.</p>

<p>"Lord Lancaster's, then; and just as good as mine,
since he is too poor to live at home. But that is no concern
of yours. I repeat&mdash;how dared you play on the
piano?"</p>

<p>Leonora looked very innocent and wondering and candid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I assure you I have not injured the piano one bit,"
she said. "It is a very nice one; but I understand how to
use it, and my touch is very soft."</p>

<p>"Who cares about your touch? I was not talking
about that. No one cares for that," contemptuously.
"I referred to your impertinence in coming out of your
proper place in the housekeeper's rooms and entering this
drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Oh!" intelligently.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you mean by 'oh'?" inquired the angry
dowager.</p>

<p>"I mean that there was no harm done by my entrance
here. I have not hurt anything. I was very curious to
know what great people's houses looked like, so I persuaded
my aunt to let me come and see; but I really can not
understand what terrible offense I have committed against
your ladyship," said Leonora, with her gentle, candid
air.</p>

<p>"You are poor and lowly born, and your place is in the
rooms of the servants, and&mdash;and&mdash;I thought you were a
child," sputtered Lady Lancaster, unable to fence with
the polished tools of her fair opponent, and continuing,
incoherently: "What did you mean, anyway, by&mdash;by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By being a tall, grown-up girl instead of a child?" interposed
Leonora, allowing a soft little smile to flicker
over her rosy lips. "Oh, Lady Lancaster, pray be reasonable!
Could I help it, really? Can one turn back the
hands of Time? If that were possible, surely <i>you</i> would
have availed yourself long ago of that wondrous art;" and
with a graceful little bow, Leonora walked deliberately out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of the room, having fired this Parthian shot of delicate
feminine spite into the camp of the astounded enemy.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster was purple with rage and dismay. She
had sallied upon the field ready to drive the intruder from
her grounds, and she, Lady Lancaster, the great rich lady,
had been vanquished by the sharp little tongue of a low-born
girl who had so innocent and candid an air that she
did not at this moment quite realize that the girl herself
knew the enormity of the offense she had committed.</p>

<p>Elise, full of silent, demure laughter, waited for her
mistress to speak.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before she rallied from her fit of
rage enough to speak clearly. When she did, she said,
sharply:</p>

<p>"Put me into a chair, Elise, and bring Mrs. West to
me."</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better take you back to your room first?
Perhaps some one may come in here. And you have
pushed your wig awry, and the powder is all off your face,
my lady," said Elise, demurely; and her mistress groaned:</p>

<p>"Take me back to my room, then, and tell West to
come at once&mdash;at once, do you hear?"</p>

<p>And when she had regained the privacy of her own room
she sunk down exhausted upon her bed to await the housekeeper's
arrival.</p>

<p>Leonora had already gone to Mrs. West's room and related
her adventure.</p>

<p>"And oh! Aunt West, she was so proud and scornful
and overbearing that I was vexed at her; and I'm afraid
that I was just a little bit saucy to her. What will she do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
do you think? Will she send me away from Lancaster
Park?"</p>

<p>"She will have to send me too if she does!" cried Mrs.
West.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt West, would you really go? Would you give
up the home of sixteen years for my sake?" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I would go. You have no one but me, and I
mean to do the best I can for your happiness. If Lady
Lancaster is unreasonable about this matter, I shall leave
her," said Mrs. West, decidedly.</p>

<p>"But, oh, aunt, you will be sorry that I came to you&mdash;sorry
that poor papa left me on your hands," anxiously.</p>

<p>"I shall regret nothing, dear, if I can only do my duty
by you," was the reassuring reply that brought a look of
relief into Leonora's beautiful face.</p>

<p>Then Elise came with Lady Lancaster's message. She
looked curiously at the calm, unruffled face of Leonora.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss West, you have seriously offended my mistress!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Have I?" Leonora answered, demurely; and Elise
knew by the gleam under the girl's long lashes that she
did not care. She delivered her message and departed.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to make of that Miss West; but
she is decidedly too proud and too pretty for her position,"
Elise said to herself, when she was going slowly back upstairs
to her mistress. "I'm afraid she will cause Mrs.
West to lose her place."</p>

<p>Mrs. West went upstairs to the great lady, and Leonora
waited in the little sitting-room for her return, which occurred
in about fifteen minutes. The housekeeper was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
somewhat red in the face, and her lips were curved rather
sternly.</p>

<p>"Well, aunt, have you promised to send me away?"
the young girl asked, demurely.</p>

<p>"She would have liked to have me do so," said Mrs.
West, indignantly. "She was very arrogant and presuming.
She seems to be quite angry because poor Dick's
daughter is as pretty and accomplished as the young ladies
in a higher rank of life."</p>

<p>Leonora smiled, and her aunt continued:</p>

<p>"I gave warning that I would leave her in a month.
If it were not for Lord Lancaster, I would go to-day; but
he has always been so kind that I shall stay a few weeks
longer for his sake. Can you endure it that much longer,
my child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Leonora, "I will try to be very good
that long. And, Aunt West, when we leave here we are
going back to New York. You need not shake your head
so solemnly. I am a willful child, and I mean to have my
own way."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>Lord Lancaster received a message from his aunt that
evening. She wished to see him privately for ten minutes.</p>

<p>"I hope she isn't going to tease me about Lady Adela
again," he said to himself, and he looked rather sullen
when he went to her. He was exceedingly impatient of
the rule she tried to exercise over him.</p>

<p>"Clive, why didn't you tell me about that girl?" she
began, dashing into the subject without preamble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>He was honestly bewildered by the suddenness of the inquiry.
He did not think of connecting Leonora West
with it.</p>

<p>"I do not know what you are talking about, Aunt
Lydia," he answered.</p>

<p>She gave him a keen glance to see if he was trying to
deceive her; but his fair, handsome face expressed only the
most honest surprise. "I mean that West girl&mdash;the
housekeeper's niece," she said. "Why didn't you tell me
about her when you came home?"</p>

<p>He reflected a moment, and then answered:</p>

<p>"I did, Aunt Lydia. You asked me if I had brought
Leonora West to the housekeeper, and I told you that I had
done so. Then you asked me if she were troublesome, and
I told you that she was. Do you not remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but you should have told me more about her. It
is very strange that you kept it all to yourself," she said,
regarding him suspiciously, and nowise pleased when she
saw the deep flush that reddened his face.</p>

<p>"What was it you wished me to tell you?" he inquired,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Why, that she was grown up instead of a child, as I
thought, and&mdash;and&mdash;that she was pretty&mdash;rather&mdash;and accomplished
beyond her station," wrathfully said Lady
Lancaster.</p>

<p>"I supposed you would find that out for yourself in due
time," he replied with a half smile that nettled her, for
she was decidedly uneasy over the discovery she had made.
She was by no means blind to the distracting beauty of
Leonora, and it had not taken her five minutes to find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that her mind was cultured and her accomplishments of a
high order. When she reflected that her nephew had
crossed the ocean in this dangerous society, she was frightened
for her plans concerning him. What if they should
"gang aglee?"</p>

<p>"Did you have any selfish motives in keeping the fact
to yourself so long?" she inquired, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," he replied, coldly.</p>

<p>"You do not? Yet you must have known that I would
be surprised. You knew I expected a child. You must
have supposed that I would not care to have such a girl&mdash;an
adventuress, perhaps&mdash;or, may be, a low concert or
saloon singer&mdash;who can tell?&mdash;here at Lancaster Park."</p>

<p>The angry flash of his eyes did not escape her keen gaze.
She had spoken with a deliberate purpose.</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster, I do not think any one but yourself
would dare say such things of Miss West," he said, hotly.</p>

<p>"Dare? Why not? What do you know to the contrary?"
sneered the evil old woman.</p>

<p>"I know Miss West herself; no one who knows her
would believe her to be an adventuress. She is a pure,
simple, and true-hearted maiden," he answered, steadily.</p>

<p>"Ah! so you are interested in her? I thought as
much," declared Lady Lancaster, violently. "This,
then, is the secret of your indifference to Lady Adela.
You have conceived a preference for this low-born, impertinent
girl. But beware, sir, how you trifle with me. Remember
my conditions."</p>

<p>Flushing to the roots of his hair, Lancaster neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
affirmed nor denied her accusations. He sat gazing at her
in proud silence.</p>

<p>"Answer me one thing," she stormed. "Do you intend
to marry Lady Adela?"</p>

<p>"I have not made up my mind yet," he answered,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Do you ever expect to do so?" she sneered. "You
have been acquainted with Lady Adela long enough, I
think, to tell whether you are pleased with her or not."</p>

<p>"It is scarcely a week," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you want more time?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"How much?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"The utmost limit your liberality will allow me."</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster reflected for a moment, with her head
on one side, like some brooding bird of evil omen.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "You shall not say I was impatient
with you. Lady Adela will stay with us a month
yet. You shall have the whole of that time to make up
your mind, and then you must give me your answer. I
can not believe that you are fool enough to let it be an unfavorable
one."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he replied, with a bow.</p>

<p>"You need not thank me for nothing," sharply. "Of
course I know you will have more sense than to refuse
twenty thousand a year, unless," sneering, "you mean to
become a suitor for the hand of that West creature."</p>

<p>Stung to retaliation, he answered:</p>

<p>"Miss West can boast a suitor more eligible than myself
in point of that 'filthy lucre' you hold so dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>She started, and gave him a keen glance.</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant De Vere."</p>

<p>"No!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Why should you look so surprised?
He was our <i>compagnon du voyage</i>. He admired
Miss West very much, and he confided to me his intention
of winning her, if possible, for his wife."</p>

<p>"His family will not allow him to throw himself away
on that girl," she cried.</p>

<p>"He is quite independent of his family, and he will not
be slow to avail himself of the advantage."</p>

<p>"Happy mortal! You would like to exchange places
with him, no doubt?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"I could wish, certainly, that I were as fortunate as my
friend," he replied.</p>

<p>She glared at him a moment, and then asked, curiously:</p>

<p>"Is the girl in love with De Vere? Pshaw! what would
love have to do with it? I mean, will she accept her
wealthy suitor?"</p>

<p>"She will if she is worldly wise," slowly. "But I can
not tell. I do not know Miss West well enough to decide
what she would do in a given case."</p>

<p>"Of course she will accept him. She is sharp enough,
and such a girl as she is&mdash;poor and lowly born&mdash;would not
be slow to jump at such a chance," said the dowager,
coarsely. "If I had known that Lieutenant De Vere was
so silly, I should not have invited him here. I would have
had nothing to do with him. But he will be here to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is here now. He went to his dressing-room an
hour ago," Lancaster said, coolly. "I think he will express
a desire for a private interview with you this evening.
It is rather embarrassing to him to have to ask your
permission to woo his lady-love in the housekeeper's
rooms, yet such is his avowed intention. If I&mdash;" he
paused and bit his lip to keep back the impatient avowal.</p>

<p>"If you&mdash;what? Go on, my lord&mdash;let me hear what
wonderful thought was prefaced by that 'if.'"</p>

<p>"Only this&mdash;if I were master in my own house instead
of a guest, it should be otherwise. My friend should not
be insulted."</p>

<p>"You would bring that creature into the drawing-room
to receive his addresses?" she hissed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then you will not do so while I am the mistress of
Lancaster. If he chooses to have such low tastes, it is not
for me to indulge him in them. If he must woo the
housekeeper's niece, he may woo her in her proper place,"
cried Lady Lancaster, indignant at his defense of his
friend's misplaced admiration, and secretly jealous of the
beautiful girl's influence.</p>

<p>What if Lancaster, too, had been bewitched by that fair,
piquant face and luring smile?</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to her.</p>

<p>After all, perhaps, it were best for her plans that De
Vere should have his way. Who could tell what folly
might get into Lancaster's head?</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was hasty," she said. "But I had a shock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to-day when I first saw the girl, and&mdash;she was very impertinent
to me. Is it your wish, Clive, that I should put
no obstacle in the way of Lieutenant De Vere's designs?"</p>

<p>He bowed silently. A swift, sharp, cruel pang of jealousy
tore through his heart as he did so. "To see her
another's&mdash;Oh, God! it would be harder than death!" he
said to himself, and yet there was no hope for him. Why
should he stand in another's light?</p>

<p>Her keen eyes detected the shadow on his face, and she
interpreted it aright. She was frightened at the danger
that had been so near her, unknown and unsuspected all
this while.</p>

<p>"I must remove the temptation from him as soon as I
can," she thought, anxiously.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>"Lord Lancaster, I want to ask you something,"
said Lady Adela Eastwood.</p>

<p>It was in the evening after the gentlemen had come in
from their walnuts and wine. Lord Lancaster had retired
rather sulkily to a corner, and the earl's daughter had followed
him and sat down near him.</p>

<p>She looked very handsome in her dinner-dress of rose-pink
satin draped with creamy lace. Her brilliant black
eyes searched his face eagerly, as she said:</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster has been telling us the strangest story
before the gentlemen came in. I am going to ask you if
it is true."</p>

<p>He tried to rouse himself to interest in her theme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I know that Lady Lancaster can be
very interesting," sarcastically. "What is it all about,
Lady Adela?"</p>

<p>She lowered her voice, and glanced across the room
where Lieutenant De Vere sat with rather a bored look on
his face, trying to become interested in the lively chatter
of the pretty Miss Dean.</p>

<p>"It is about that handsome Lieutenant De Vere," she
said; "Lady Lancaster has been telling us that he is infatuated
with a ridiculous creature&mdash;a servant, I think she
said, or something like that. And he is going to propose
to her, and it will most likely be a match. Now, you are
his friend, Lord Lancaster. Please tell me if it is really
so?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not," he replied, pulling savagely at the innocent
ends of his long mustache.</p>

<p>"Then it is not true? Lady Lancaster was only telling
it to tease Emma Dean, I fancy. Emma has been setting
her cap at the lieutenant, you know. She will be very
glad to hear it was all a joke."</p>

<p>"But it was not a joke, really," he said, embarrassed.
"You know what Tennyson says about a 'lie that is half a
truth,' Lady Adela. Well, that is how the case stands.
Lady Lancaster has simply misrepresented the facts.
There was a grain of truth in her bushel of falsehood."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" cried Lady Adela, in dismay. She nestled
a little nearer him on the fauteuil where they were sitting.
"Do tell me the right of it, Lord Lancaster; I am all curiosity."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you the right of it, if you care to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
hear," he replied; and there was so stern a look on his face
that the earl's daughter was frightened. She wondered if
he was angry with her.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not offended with me for repeating
what Lady Lancaster said," she observed sweetly, giving
him a demure look out of her large black eyes.</p>

<p>He looked at her gravely a minute without replying.
She was very handsome, certainly&mdash;a brilliant brunette,
very vivacious when it pleased her to be so, and again with
a languor and indolence amounting to laziness. She had
been in society several seasons, and owned to twenty-three
years old. She was beautiful, graceful, and dignified, and
Lancaster felt that she would make a fitting mistress for
Lancaster Park; but his pulse did not beat any faster at
her bright glance, nor at her sweet, half-confidential
tones.</p>

<p>But he looked back at her reassuringly as he replied:</p>

<p>"I am sorry I looked so black as to inspire you with
such an idea, Lady Adela. Of course I am not offended
with you. You are not answerable for Lady Lancaster's
peccadilloes. I think, however, that she might have
shown more respect to Lieutenant De Vere than to indulge
herself in such gossip, more than half of it being false."</p>

<p>"Oh, then he isn't going to commit such a folly after
all?" she exclaimed, relieved that it was not so, for her
patrician pride had been somewhat hurt at the idea of one
of her own order descending to a plebeian.</p>

<p>"You jump so quickly from one conclusion to another,
Lady Adela, that you will not give me time to explain,"
he said, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, abashed. "Then I shall not say
another word, only listen to your story."</p>

<p>"There is no story&mdash;only an explanation," he said. "I
should not speak of it, only I think De Vere would thank
me for setting him right. Yes, he is in love, Lady Adela,
but not with a servant girl, as my aunt insinuated. The
young lady who has won his heart is a fair, refined young
girl, cultured and accomplished, and of respectable
although not noble birth. She is an American girl who
came over with De Vere and myself from New York to her
aunt, who is the housekeeper here. That is the long and
the short of the servant-girl story."</p>

<p>"You know her?" cried Lady Adela, amazed. "Oh,
how I would like to see this fascinating girl, admired both
by Lieutenant De Vere and Lord Lancaster!"</p>

<p>"You have seen her," he replied, with that quick flush
that showed so clearly through his fine skin.</p>

<p>"Where?" she cried, amazed.</p>

<p>"You remember the young lady we saw sketching
among the ruins yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"It was Miss West&mdash;De Vere's inamorata," he answered.</p>

<p>Lady Adela did not speak for a moment. She was surprised
into silence. When she recovered her speech, she
said, faintly:</p>

<p>"You said she was staying in the neighborhood for the
sketching."</p>

<p>"That was a small fib, Lady Adela, for which I humbly
crave your pardon. The truth is that Miss West's father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
lately dead, has left his daughter to Mrs. West's care. She
is staying at Lancaster because she has no other home."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then she is the housekeeper's niece. I presume
that is the reason Lady Lancaster called her a servant,"
said the earl's daughter, in a tone that quite excused the
dowager.</p>

<p>He gave her a quick look which, not being an adept in
reading expressions, Lady Adela did not understand.</p>

<p>"No, she is not Mrs. West's niece. Her father's
brother was Mrs. West's husband. There is all the relationship
there is," he said, almost curtly.</p>

<p>Lady Adela gave him a glance that was rather haughty,
yet half jealous.</p>

<p>"I can see that Lieutenant De Vere has a zealous champion
in you," she said, with a tincture of bitterness in her
voice.</p>

<p>"I do not think he needs or desires a champion," he
answered.</p>

<p>"No? And why not?" she asked. "Surely he must
be aware that he will be censured by many for his course
in marrying below his own station in life. He will need
some one to make excuses for him."</p>

<p>"His wife, if he wins her, will be an all-sufficient excuse
for him," Lancaster said, calmly.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, rather piqued at his words.</p>

<p>"Because Miss West is quite fascinating enough to make
any man excusable for his folly, if folly it be," he replied.</p>

<p>"You are very complimentary to her," Lady Adela
said, with her head held high. "I can not see how she
could be so fascinating. I did not think she was so very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
pretty, really. She had quite common brown hair, and
gray eyes, I think, and one of those baby faces that some
people admire, but which I never did."</p>

<p>"It is not at all a baby face," he said. "She has a
great deal of character and decision in it, I think."</p>

<p>"Indeed? But, of course, you have had a better chance
of studying her face than I have, and may be a better
judge. I think you are more than half-way in love with
the housekeeper's niece yourself," Lady Adela exclaimed,
flashing a reproachful glance upon him, for, being well
aware of Lady Lancaster's scheme, she felt that he belonged
to her.</p>

<p>"De Vere would not like that much," he said, carelessly,
without betraying his inward vexation.</p>

<p>She fanned herself rapidly with her pink satin fan for a
moment, then said, with a keen glance at him:</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster has formed a fine plan for showing
him his folly and breaking off the affair."</p>

<p>"Really?" he inquired, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yes; she is quite sure that if he could once see this
girl in the company of real ladies, he would see the difference
and become disenchanted."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"It seems as if the girl can play quite well," said Lady
Adela, going on in her low, confidential tones. "And the
ladies are all curious to see her. So Lady Lancaster is
going to have her in to play for us, just for a pretext, you
know; and then Lieutenant De Vere can not help seeing
the difference between her and the women of his own set.
Perhaps it will cure him of his fancy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Lancaster, dryly; but his heart began
to beat. Would Lady Lancaster really bring Leonora into
the drawing-room? Something assured him that if she
did it would only be to humiliate and snub her. He read
this intuitively in Lady Adela's supercilious expression.
His heart swelled with hot resentment. He rose hurriedly.</p>

<p>"She shall not send for her," he said; but the earl's
daughter answered, with ill-concealed malice:</p>

<p>"She has already done so."</p>

<p>"Then she shall not come. I will myself forbid it," he
exclaimed; but even as the words left his lips, he paused
and stood for a moment speechless. The drawing-room
door had opened just then, and Leonora West stood just
inside of it, hesitating on the threshold.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>"Oh, Lord Lancaster, you are too late! She is come
now!" cried Lady Adela, for her glance, too, had fallen
on the graceful, hesitating figure. She saw with inexpressible
chagrin that Leonora was in simple but faultless
costume. Her dress, of some soft, shining, thin, black
material, was of stylish and fashionable make, and her
white shoulders and arms gleamed marble-white through
the thin folds. She had arranged all her rich tresses of
chestnut hair in loose puffs and waves on the top of her
head, and fastened a single spray of starry white jasmine
flowers at the side. Some of the same sweet, fragrant
blossoms fastened the full ruff of white crêpe lisse at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
round, white throat, and constituted her only adorning.
Her white arms and dimpled wrist, left bare by the elbow-sleeves
of her dress, were more beautiful in their shapely
grace than Lady Adela's ten-button gloves and diamond
bracelets.</p>

<p>"She has had the impertinence to get herself up in full
evening dress, the minx!" the earl's daughter muttered,
almost audibly; and then she uttered a suppressed exclamation
of annoyance, for Lord Lancaster had started for
her side, and was making his way rapidly across the room
to the door.</p>

<p>"He has left me for her!" was her jealous, angry
thought, and a sudden hatred for Leonora entered her
heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lord Lancaster had reached the spot where
the girl was standing, with a slightly heightened color on
her face, but with that quiet air of self-possession she habitually
wore. She was not at all overwhelmed by the
honor Lady Lancaster had thrust upon her, but she was a
little indignant at the dowager, who purposely left her
standing there alone, taking care that De Vere did not see
her and go to her rescue.</p>

<p>But she forgot her nephew sitting in full view across the
room, or she thought that he would not forsake the side of
Lady Adela. What was her amazement when she saw him
standing by the girl's side, saw the fair face lifted to his
with a grateful smile!</p>

<p>"Lady Lancaster has commanded your humble servant
to appear before your highness and execute divers pieces of
music," she was saying, mischievously, when the dowager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
pounced down upon them like a hawk, and, with an angry
aside to her nephew, bore Leonora off to the piano.</p>

<p>The next minute De Vere came forward gladly. By
this time every one was looking, yet he was in nowise intimidated.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss West, how glad I am to meet you, and looking
as charming as ever, too!" in an audible aside, while
his face beamed with delight. Leonora drew her hand
rather hastily away.</p>

<p>"I am not here on equal terms, please remember that,"
she said, turning around and sitting down on the piano-stool.
"It is my lady's orders that I shall amuse the company."</p>

<p>"Then I shall turn your music&mdash;may I?" he entreated.</p>

<p>She gave a careless assent, and looked at the great pile
of music.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will select something to play," she said;
and seeing, without turning her head, that Lancaster had
gone back to his seat by the earl's daughter.</p>

<p>"He is afraid she will be jealous of me," the girl said to
herself, with the least little curl of her red lip.</p>

<p>"Can you play this?" De Vere inquired, placing a
simple little song before her.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I do not want a song, please. Give me
something by Mozart or Rossini&mdash;something brilliant. I
am on exhibition, you see," saucily.</p>

<p>"Can you really play Mozart?" he whispered to her as
he searched for the music.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and Beethoven, too. I am fond of music, so
I have studied it a great deal. I can play almost anything,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
she said, carelessly, as she took the piece he handed
her&mdash;an exceedingly brilliant and difficult piece by
Mozart, and ran her quick eyes over it.</p>

<p>She placed the music before her, and struck the first
notes. The hum of voices in the room grew instantly still.
No one spoke while that grand torrent of music rose and
fell on the charmed air, as those slim white fingers of Leonora
swept the echoing keys. They forgot the performer
for a little, even as she forgot them. Her cheeks glowed,
her eyes sparkled. While she played she remembered
nothing but the harmonies that were shed from her subtle
finger-touches. The art of the grand composer charmed
her, and when she paused at last, it was with a low sigh of
blended pain and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Brava!" said De Vere, bending over her, and she
smiled.</p>

<p>"Have I done well? It is because I have a passion for
music, and have given my soul to it."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>It was quite likely that De Vere would see the difference
between his lowly born love and the real ladies in the room,
as Lady Adela had said, but that he would be disenchanted
was quite another matter. There certainly appeared to be
no chance of it now. He was charmed with the splendid
musical talent she had evinced. He felt a glow of pride
in her as if she belonged to him already.</p>

<p>"You have done splendidly," he whispered, as he hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
delightedly over her. "There is not a lady in the room
who can do half so well."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she replied, demurely. "But you had
better give me another piece. I am here to play, not to
talk."</p>

<p>He longed to say, "Give me the right to place you on
an equality with these women as my wife," but he was
afraid to venture yet. Something in her cold, careless
manner forbade the thought. He said to himself that he
must wait until he knew her longer and had wooed her
more. She was not to be lightly won, this beautiful gifted
girl. She was proud and sensitive. He would have to
bide his time.</p>

<p>So with a smothered sigh he placed before her several
pieces, and while she played he stood silently by her side,
turning the leaves of her music, and gazing into the beautiful,
soulful face, proud and glad in the privilege he enjoyed
of being so near her.</p>

<p>When she had played several instrumental pieces brilliantly,
he placed another song before her.</p>

<p>"Let me hear if you can sing as well as you can play,"
he pleaded.</p>

<p>She glanced at the song. It was Longfellow's
"Bridge."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will sing it," she said; and again there fell a
hush of silence as the sweet and well-trained voice filled
the room with its melody. De Vere was fain to acknowledge
that she sung as well as she played.</p>

<p>When she had sung the last line she looked up into his
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you play or sing something now while I rest?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I never knew how unfortunate I was before in having
no talent for music," he said, ruefully. "I should like to
oblige you so much, but I have no more voice than a
raven, Miss West. I will call Lancaster. He can sing
like a seraph."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray don't!" she cried; but he had already turned
around.</p>

<p>"Lancaster," he called, "won't you come and sing
something while Miss West has a breathing-spell?"</p>

<p>He came forward at once. He thought it would be very
pleasant to displace De Vere for a moment, to stand by
her side and watch her exquisite face and the glancing
white hands as they moved over the shining pearl keys.</p>

<p>"Pray do not rise," he said, bending over her, hurriedly;
"I will sing, but I shall want you to play my accompaniment."</p>

<p>She bowed silently, and he selected a piece of music and
placed it before her. It was that beautiful song, "My
Queen."</p>

<p>"He is going to sing to Lady Adela," the girl said to
herself, a little disdainfully, but her touch was firm and
unfaltering as she struck the chords while Lord Lancaster
sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where and how shall I earliest meet her?<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Ere I cease to love her, my Queen, my Queen!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>De Vere did not like his friend's selection much. He
regretted that he had asked him to sing.</p>

<p>"It sounds like he was singing to her," he said, discontentedly
to himself as he watched the couple at the piano.
"What does the fellow mean, and what will Lady Adela
think?" he wondered; and glancing toward her he saw
that she was looking very cross over the top of her fan.
Truth to tell, she was very much in doubt whether to appropriate
the song to herself.</p>

<p>When the song was ended De Vere, who had lingered
jealously near the piano, went up to Leonora's side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you were going to rest while some one else
sung," he said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>She glanced up with a smile at Lord Lancaster.</p>

<p>"So I was," she replied, lightly, "but Captain Lancaster
wished me to play while he sung for Lady Adela. So
of course I could not refuse."</p>

<p>Lancaster gazed into her face with amazement. Was
she indeed so blind, or did she purposely slight the tribute
he had paid to her, and which he had believed she could
not fail to understand? Angered and chagrined, he bowed
his thanks coldly, and retired from the piano, leaving a
fair field for his rival.</p>

<p>He went out through the open window and wandered
into the grounds, driven from her presence by the pain of
her coldness, her studied indifference. There was a gulf
between them that grew wider and wider at every effort he
made to bridge it.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me! I am a fool to waste my heart on
one who laughs at my love," he said to himself. "I will
tear her from my heart. I will never show her again the
tenderness of a heart she chooses to trample. She will
choose De Vere. That is wise. He is rich, I have nothing
but Lancaster. Yet, if she would love me, I could bear
poverty without a sigh, deeming myself rich in her affection."</p>

<p>His aimless walk led him to the Magic Mirror, where he
had come upon her so suddenly and with such irrepressible
joy that night. If only she had listened to him then, she
would have known the whole story of that passionate love
wherewith he loved her&mdash;she did not even care to hear, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
said to himself with bitter pain and humiliation as he
gazed into the clear pool from which her face had shone
on him that night, and fooled him with the love he
thought he saw on the lips and in the eyes.</p>

<p>He had always been gay and light-hearted until now,
but an hour of profound bitterness came to him to-night
alone in the odorous moonlit stillness. The words of Leonora's
song seemed to echo in his brain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For my heart was hot and restless,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And my life was full of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the burden laid upon me<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Seemed greater than I could bear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I wish that I could go back to my regiment to-morrow,"
he thought. "Why should I linger on here, and
how will it all end, I wonder? Will De Vere marry Leonora?
shall I marry Lady Adela? What will fate do with
the tangled thread of our lives, I wonder?"</p>

<p>He went back to the house, and he found that Leonora
was gone, and that De Vere had gone over to the fauteuil,
and was talking to the earl's daughter. Several of the
men had formed a coterie around Lady Lancaster, and
were good-naturedly upbraiding her because she had declined
to present them to the beautiful musician.</p>

<p>"I could not do it, really," said the dowager. "She is
not in our set at all. She is a mere nobody, the dependent
niece of my housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Well, but Lancaster and De Vere were quite hand-in-glove
with her," objected one.</p>

<p>"A mere accidental acquaintance. She came over from
America with them," said the dowager, carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, she was inwardly raging with vexation. Her
clever plan for annihilating Leonora had failed. The girl
had appeared to much more advantage than she had expected&mdash;had
created a sensation, in fact. The men were all
in raptures, the women were all angry and jealous, and
Leonora's modest withdrawal from the scene as soon as she
arose from the piano was felt by all as a relief.</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Vere had gone with her as far as the
door. He had held her hand a minute in saying good-night.</p>

<p>"May I come into Mrs. West's room and see you to-morrow?"
he asked, with an entreating glance into the
bright eyes, and he saw a gleam of mischief shining in
them.</p>

<p>"Will Lady Lancaster permit you to do so?" she inquired,
demurely.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I have told her quite frankly the
reason why I came to Lancaster Park, and she had nothing
to say against it. If you will let me see you to-morrow,
I will tell you what I told her," he continued,
with his heart beating fast as he gazed at her fresh young
beauty.</p>

<p>She was very thoughtful for an instant. She seemed to
be making up her mind.</p>

<p>"You must not say no," he said, hastily. "I assure
you that Lady Lancaster will have no objection to my doing
so, if your aunt will permit me. May I come?"</p>

<p>Leonora raised her eyes gravely to his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may come," she answered, and then turned
quickly away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>The impulses of men in love are as various as their natures.
Where one will linger around the fatal charmer and
hug his pain, another will fly from</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"The cruel madness of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honey of poison-flowers, and all the measureless ill."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lancaster, being wise, chose the latter part. He had
an innate conviction that Leonora would accept Lieutenant
De Vere. He did not feel strong enough to witness his
friend's happiness just yet. He felt that if he remained he
might betray his passion and be laughed at for his pains.
He sought safety from himself in ignominious flight.</p>

<p>What was Lady Lancaster's dismay next morning, when
she arose to her late breakfast, to find a note awaiting her
from that troublesome nephew. She was in a great rage
when she read it. She pushed back her dainty, untasted
repast, which had been served in the privacy of her own
room, and rang her bell violently.</p>

<p>"Present my compliments to Lieutenant De Vere, and
ask him to come to me for ten minutes," she said, sharply,
to the servant who answered the summons.</p>

<p>He came immediately, full of wonder at this abrupt
summons, and found her pacing up and down the floor in
a great rage which she did not take any pains to conceal.</p>

<p>"Did you know of any reason Lord Lancaster could
have for going up to London this morning?" she asked
him, after they had gone through the preliminaries of a
hasty good-morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he replied, gazing at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, he has gone&mdash;did you know that?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard from his groom that he went at daylight
this morning," he replied.</p>

<p>"Here is a note he left for me," she said, angrily.
"He says he has been suddenly called away by urgent
business&mdash;may be detained a week or more, and wishes me
to present excuses and regrets to you and the rest of the
company."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry he had to go," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"But do you believe that he really has business?" she
inquired, peevishly.</p>

<p>"Of course he had&mdash;or why should he have gone?" inquired
the handsome young fellow, staring at her in
amazement.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;but I have my suspicions. I half believe
that he has run away from me and Lady Adela. If
I were quite sure of it, I'd have my revenge," she muttered,
irascibly.</p>

<p>"What an old shrew! I don't blame Lancaster for
running away. I'm quite sure I should do so, too, if she
bullied me as she does Lancaster," said the young fellow
to himself, but aloud, he said, with an air of surprise:</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Lancaster, I am sure you wrong my
friend. Why should he run away from you, his kind
friend, and from the beautiful Lady Adela?"</p>

<p>"Ah, why? I have my suspicions, Lieutenant De
Vere, but I shall not impart them to any one&mdash;at least not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
yet. But he has behaved very badly, going off like this.
I do not know how to make excuses for him, least of all
to Lady Adela. She was jealous last night. I could see
that. What will she say now? Clive has been playing
fast and loose with me ever since last fall. It can not go
on forever. I shall make him understand that."</p>

<p>"Do not be too hard upon him. Give him time, Lady
Lancaster. He will not brook harshness, he will break a
tight rein and escape from it. You should know that
much of all men's natures," said De Vere, pleading for
his friend.</p>

<p>"I have not been hard upon him. I have been most
patient; but his behavior is inexplicable," cried she. "I
have offered a wife and a fortune to him&mdash;a beautiful,
high-bred, high-born wife, and a splendid fortune&mdash;yet he
is indifferent to both. All Lady Adela's beauty makes no
impression on him. He is barely civil to her. What is
the matter with him, Lieutenant De Vere? Is he going to
be fool enough to fly in the face of his own good fortune?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Lieutenant De Vere, but he looked
very anxious. He remembered that "whom the gods wish
to destroy they first make mad."</p>

<p>Lancaster was mad&mdash;mad with love for the beautiful,
penniless American girl, Leonora West. De Vere had
suspected it all along, he was sure of it now. That song
last night had opened his eyes. A pang of bitter, futile
jealousy shot through his heart. He believed that his
friend was an unacknowledged rival. A vague terror of
the end rushed over him. Who would win, Lancaster or
himself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Lancaster came nearer to him&mdash;she looked anxiously
at him with her small, bead-like black eyes.</p>

<p>"You and Clive are intimate," she said; "you ought
to know a great deal about him. Tell me what it is that
makes him so blind to his own interests? Is there any one
in the way? Is there any woman in the case?"</p>

<p>"I am not in Lancaster's confidence, believe me, Lady
Lancaster," he replied. "If there be any woman in the
case, he has never told me so. Perhaps you are making a
mountain out of a little mole-hill."</p>

<p>She studied him attentively.</p>

<p>"You are his friend. I shall find out nothing from
you. I can see that," she said.</p>

<p>"You will never learn anything from me derogatory to
his interests&mdash;be sure of that," he replied, loyal to his
friend in spite of his reawakened jealousy.</p>

<p>"And your own wooing&mdash;how does that prosper?" she
inquired, with something like a sneer, abruptly changing
the subject.</p>

<p>He flushed indignantly.</p>

<p>"You are pleased to jest on delicate subjects, Lady Lancaster,"
he said, stiffly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she answered, quickly, "I did
not know you were so sensitive, but I assure you that I
take a great interest in your love affair."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I understand the origin of your great
interest," he answered with a slight smile; and she winced
perceptibly. She did not want him to know whither her
suspicions tended.</p>

<p>"I dare say you think me a very meddlesome old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
woman," she said, abruptly; "but you have my best
wishes for a successful suit. Miss West is beautiful and
accomplished, and with your wealth you can have no difficulty
in lifting her to your level."</p>

<p>"She is the most beautiful of women," he answered,
forgetting his momentary ill-humor in the pleasure she
awoke in him by her artful praise of Leonora.</p>

<p>"And you will lose no time in making her your own?
Delays are dangerous," she said, with a subtle meaning in
her tone that made his heart beat.</p>

<p>"I know that. But I am a coward; I am almost afraid
to ask her for the boon I crave most upon earth," he said,
giving her in those few words a glimpse into his full heart.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! you are a coward," said my lady, laughing.
"Where is the woman who is going to refuse you with
your face and your fortune? You are a prize in the matrimonial
market."</p>

<p>"But I want to be accepted for myself, and not for my
fortune, Lady Lancaster," he answered, proudly, and yet
not without a sense of satisfaction over these worldly advantages
of his. It was very pleasant to be his own master,
to be able to do as he pleased, to ask no one's leave to
marry whom he wished.</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster laughed a very disagreeable laugh.</p>

<p>"As I am such an old woman, you will forgive me for
telling you not to be a fool, Lieutenant De Vere," she
said. "There are very few men who are married for
themselves alone in these days, and, let me add, there are
very few who deserve it. The average woman looks out
for money and position now. Be sensible, and thank your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
lucky stars that when you go to court Miss West you can
carry a fortune in your hand, as well as a heart."</p>

<p>"What a very disagreeable old woman!" he said to
himself, reddening with vexation. "She is full of spleen
and venom. I must go out or I shall be tempted to say
something sharp to her."</p>

<p>He went, and as he was leaving, she fired a last shot at
him:</p>

<p>"Take my advice, and don't delay the proposal, young
man. Don't let excessive modesty deter you. Remember
that faint heart never won fair lady."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Sitting in the quiet little room of Mrs. West that
morning, with the golden sunlight of June shining in
through the screen of flowers at the window, the pretty
American girl listened to the story of the <i>grande passion</i>
told in as eloquent phrases as the young soldier could command&mdash;a
story as old as the world, but ever sweet and
new.</p>

<p>Leonora listened with dewy eyes and flushing cheeks.
She knew the value of all that he was offering to her&mdash;knew
that he was wealthy, that he was heir to a
title, that he had a warm, true, manly heart, and that
in his affection for her he was running counter to the
wishes and desires of all his friends. It was but natural
that she should feel proud of his homage. She wished that
she might have loved him in return. A sense of shame
and embarrassment stole over her at the thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
while he offered her so much she could give him nothing
save the calm regard of a friend.</p>

<p>She drew away the hand of which he had possessed himself,
and the rich roses mantled her cheeks as she said,
gently and sadly:</p>

<p>"I thank you very much for the honor you have done
me, and I wish that I could love you, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what? Oh, Leonora, you are not going to be
cruel to me&mdash;you are not going to refuse me?" he cried,
anxiously, and he looked so handsome and so ardent that
her heart ached for him, and she wished again that she
might have loved him, and said yes instead of no to his
manly proposal.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said, and the pretty face looked
so shy and troubled, that he longed to gather her in his
arms and kiss the sweet lips into smiles again. "I am
very sorry, and I don't mean to be cruel, Lieutenant De
Vere&mdash;but I must refuse, because I do not love you."</p>

<p>"Let me teach you," he cried, ardently. "I know I
have been too premature. I have asked you to love me
too soon; but I have been so afraid of a rival, my darling."</p>

<p>Leonora smiled pensively and bitterly.</p>

<p>"A rival," she said, with a quickly suppressed sigh.
"Ah, you need not have feared that! No one would sacrifice
anything for my sake but you."</p>

<p>He thought he understood the allusion, and his heart
sunk. He gently touched the small hand that lay on
her black dress.</p>

<p>"Do not judge any one hardly, Miss West," he said.
"There are many who would love you and make sacrifices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
for you if they had the chance. And you know I should
not have to make any sacrifice at all. I am rich in my
own right. I could lift you at once from the level you
now occupy to one more worthy of you&mdash;one you would
adorn, and where your beauty and accomplishments would
be rated at their full value. Oh, Leonora! do not say no
just yet. Let me woo you a little longer&mdash;a month, a
year. In time you might learn to love me. Let me still
hope on. I love you so dearly I can not give you up yet!"</p>

<p>She blushed deeply, and the long lashes drooped over
her cheeks, but she answered, firmly:</p>

<p>"It would be very cruel for me to let you keep on hoping
like that, Lieutenant De Vere. I could never be yours
if you waited months and years. I will tell you the truth.
There is"&mdash;a gasp&mdash;"some one&mdash;some one else that I
love."</p>

<p>A moment's dead silence. The girl drops her shamed
face in her hands. Presently he says huskily, yet with
manly courage:</p>

<p>"It is some fortunate suitor you have left in America.
Let me congratulate you, Miss West."</p>

<p>But she answers, in a sad, shamed voice:</p>

<p>"No, you need not congratulate me. I am not any
happier than you are. He&mdash;he does not love me."</p>

<p>"Does not love you? Then he must be a stock or a
stone," De Vere says, indignantly.</p>

<p>"He is neither," says Leonora, with the pretty pensive
smile she has worn throughout their interview. "But let
us speak no more of it. I should not have confessed to
you only to show you how futile it would be for you to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
on loving me. I thought it but justice to you. It may
make it easier for you to forget me."</p>

<p>"I shall never do that," he answers, with conviction.</p>

<p>"You think so now, but time will console you," smiling.
"I shall be gone out of your life forever in a few
weeks."</p>

<p>"Gone?" he echoes, blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am going away in three weeks' time. Aunt
West goes with me to America."</p>

<p>He starts.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are going to seek a home in my own land.
Bid me <i>bon voyage</i>, Lieutenant De Vere. You are the
only friend I have made in England, that is, if I may call
you my friend," wistfully.</p>

<p>He gulps down a great sigh of disappointment, regret,
and pain, and holds out his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am your friend, if I can not be your lover," he
said, manfully.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Something like a week later Lieutenant De Vere,
strolling down a street in London, comes suddenly face to
face with Clive, Lord Lancaster.</p>

<p>"What! not gone home yet?" says the former, in surprise,
and Lancaster flushes guiltily.</p>

<p>"No; but when did you come to London?" he inquires.</p>

<p>"Several days ago," De Vere replies, carelessly, and
scanning his friend curiously. Lancaster does not bear
the scrutiny well. He is wan and haggard looking. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
is no color in his usually florid face, and his eyes are heavy
and restless.</p>

<p>"You have not finished your visit so soon, I trust," he
observes, eying his friend in turn with a close scrutiny.
De Vere has a worn air, too, as if dull and <i>ennuyé</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have finished my visit; I did not care to remain
after my host took such a cavalier flight."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" sarcastically. "But I did not know
that I was the object of your visit."</p>

<p>"You were not, particularly; but I came away because
I had no longer any excuse for staying."</p>

<p>The tone was so peculiar that Lancaster looked at him
more closely. He caught De Vere by the arm a little
nervously.</p>

<p>"De Vere, you don't mean to tell me that <i>she</i> has refused
you?"</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> is so indefinite. Whom do you mean?" airily.</p>

<p>"I thought there was but one <i>she</i> in the case. Miss
West, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Has she refused you, I say, De Vere?" imploringly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Really?" with something like incredulous joy in his
voice, though he tries hard to keep it out of it. He has
been so jealously sure all the while that Leonora would accept
"the goods the gods provided," that he can scarcely take
in the truth now.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss West has refused me, really. You seem
glad of my ill-luck, Lancaster," in a tone of subdued bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Lancaster is suddenly shocked at himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! I beg your pardon a hundred times I did
not mean it at all. I am sorry for you, old fellow, but I
can not understand it, really."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are dull of comprehension. Take a cigar
to brighten up your understanding."</p>

<p>They light their cigars and walk on together, and then
De Vere continues:</p>

<p>"What is it about the affair that you can not understand?"</p>

<p>"That she should refuse you. I thought she would be
sure to accept."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lieutenant De Vere, dryly, and then he
took several moody puffs at his cigar.</p>

<p>"Yes, I honestly thought so. Did she give you any
reason for refusing you?"</p>

<p>"Two reasons," De Vere replied, laconically.</p>

<p>"One ought to have been enough," said his friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, it ought to have been, I know," said De Vere,
reddening warmly. "But, you see, I did not want to take
no for an answer, so when she said she couldn't marry me
because she didn't love me I wanted her to take time.
You see, I thought she might learn to love me. So, then,
to escape my importunities, she had to put in another reason."</p>

<p>"And that?" asked Lancaster.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I ought to tell. I think she told
it me as a secret," he answered, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>And then when he saw Lancaster's grave, disappointed
face, he said, suddenly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me your secret, Lancaster, and I will tell you
hers. Why did you run away from Lancaster Park?"</p>

<p>"Because I was a coward, De Vere&mdash;that is all," bitterly.</p>

<p>"But why? Were you afraid that your aunt would
marry you off willy-nilly to the earl's daughter?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, although there was some danger of it,"
said Lancaster, smiling.</p>

<p>"There was some other reason, then? Come, old
fellow, are you ashamed to confess the truth?"</p>

<p>"I should have been a week ago, I think I might own
it now with the bribe you offered in view."</p>

<p>"What was it, then?" curiously.</p>

<p>"This: I was madly in love with Leonora West, and
too selfish, or too jealous, or too great a coward, to stay
and witness your happiness as her accepted lover."</p>

<p>"Hum! All the happiness you would have witnessed
wouldn't have hurt you," ruefully. "And so you ran
away like a coward! What have you been doing all this
while, truant?"</p>

<p>"All sorts of foolish things, I'm afraid. For one
thing, I've been trying to exchange out of my own regiment
into one ordered to India."</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Vere was betrayed into a whistle of profound
surprise:</p>

<p>"Whew!"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the big, handsome fellow, shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"But do you mean to tell me that you were going to
throw over the whole thing, Lady Lancaster, Lady Adela,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and all&mdash;just because you were disappointed in love?"
queried De Vere, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I was&mdash;though I didn't think much
about it. You see, I was just running away headlong
from my own misery."</p>

<p>"I did not really believe you were so romantic," said
De Vere, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"You mean so foolish," said his friend, eying him
closely.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps so," admitted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"A man must be far gone, indeed, to throw away
twenty thousand a year and an earl's daughter for the
<i>beaux yeux</i> of a pretty little penniless girl. Such luck is
not met with every day."</p>

<p>"Leonora is worth it all," said Lancaster, warmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, if one could win her; but then you were throwing
all away, without anything in return. You should
have remembered that you would lose all and gain nothing.
What says the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'What care I how fair she be,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If she be not fair for me?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lancaster said nothing, only sighed furiously.</p>

<p>"Look here, old fellow," said his friend. "Tell me
the truth. If you could get Leonora, would you really
throw over all the rest for her? Would you do the 'all
for love, and the world well lost' business?"</p>

<p>An eloquent look from Lancaster's dark-blue eyes was
his only answer.</p>

<p>"You would. Then you are far gone indeed. I do not
think I ought to countenance you in such egregious folly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I think you will be cured of your madness when I tell you
her second reason for not loving me."</p>

<p>Lancaster looked at him imploringly.</p>

<p>"Say what you are going to say, De Vere," he said,
almost roughly, in the misery that filled his voice; "but,
for God's sake, don't chaff! Think what I've endured
already. I love Leonora to madness. If you think there's
any hope for me, say so at once and put me out of misery."</p>

<p>"Lancaster, I'm sorry for you, upon my soul, but I
don't think there's any chance for you at all. Miss West
told me quite frankly that she was in love with another
man."</p>

<p>Lancaster gives a great start. He says, hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Who is the happy man?"</p>

<p>"She would not tell, but of course it can not be you,
because she says it is quite a hopeless passion. He does
not love her; she admitted that with the reddest blushes."</p>

<p>"No, of course, it can not be me, for I am quite sure she
knows my heart. I have shown her my love unwittingly
more than once, and been laughed at for my pains," Lancaster
admits, with bitter chagrin and despair struggling
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl! It is strange that she should love in
vain. It is a cold-hearted man indeed that could be insensible
to so much beauty and sweetness," De Vere
muses aloud. "I think it is some one she has left in New
York, for she and Miss West are going to sail for America
next week, to make their home there."</p>

<p>"Then that ends all," Lancaster says, moodily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," De Vere answers, rather gravely. "And there
will be one page folded down forever in both our lives, eh,
old fellow? We are in the same boat, you see. But take
my advice, Lancaster, don't let this episode spoil your
prospects. Throw up the India scheme, and go home and
marry the earl's daughter."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Lady Lancaster was surprised and angry and frightened
all in one when she heard that Leonora West had refused
Lieutenant De Vere. She made him own the truth
when he came to make his hasty adieus, and she roundly
abused the "pert minx," as she called her, for her "impertinence
and presumption."</p>

<p>"Whom does she think she will get? Does she think
she will capture an earl or a duke?" she sneered, and De
Vere answered, coldly:</p>

<p>"I do not believe that she has any matrimonial designs
on any one, Lady Lancaster. She returns to America in
a very few days."</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster was so surprised that she gave vent to
her relief in a hasty exclamation:</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! And I devoutly wish that she had
remained there."</p>

<p>"There are more persons than one who will agree with
your ladyship there," he said, betrayed into a laugh at her
naïveté.</p>

<p>"Whom?" she exclaimed, with a start.</p>

<p>"Myself for one," he answered. "I am not at liberty
to implicate any one else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave him a savage glance.</p>

<p>"Do you mean my nephew?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I said I was not at liberty to name any one else," he
replied.</p>

<p>Then he went away, and Lady Lancaster straightway
confided the fact of his rejection to all the ladies in the
house. They all agreed with her that Leonora West was
an impertinent minx to have refused such a splendid offer,
but that it was a narrow escape for Lieutenant De Vere
and that he had need to be very thankful over it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Lady Lancaster's guests grew very
curious over her nephew's absence. The earl and his
daughter talked of going away. They felt secretly aggrieved
and resentful over Lord Lancaster's continued absence.
It was a palpable slight to them. They did not
believe the story of important business in London.</p>

<p>What business could he have?</p>

<p>Lady Lancaster wrote her nephew a sharp, imperative
letter of recall. She was on thorns lest her long-cherished
scheme should fail. She intimated quite plainly that her
patience was exhausted, and that if he did not come to
terms soon she would never forgive him, and worse still,
she would cut him out of her will.</p>

<p>Lancaster threw that letter angrily into the fire, and
swore to himself that he would not go near Lancaster.
He would go off to India, and she might buy another husband
for her favorite with the money she prized so much.
He would have none of it.</p>

<p>In short, our hero was in a most sullen and intractable
mood. His heart was sorely wounded, for he had loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Leonora with all the strength and passion of a noble nature.
His sorrow for a time completely mastered him. He
said to himself that he could not bear to go back now. He
must wait a little longer.</p>

<p>Then came De Vere with his strange story. Now indeed
all was ended, thought the hopeless lover. She was
going away, and he would never even see her again, this
bright-eyed, soft-voiced girl who had stolen into his heart
almost unawares, who had been so cruel to him, who had
so lightly scorned him, and yet whom he loved with all the
strong passion of his young manhood.</p>

<p>Once or twice De Vere reiterated his advice that he
should go home and marry Lady Adela, but Lancaster
only laughed miserably in his face.</p>

<p>"What, with my heart and soul full of another
woman?" he said, bitterly. "No, I can not do that
much injustice to beautiful Lady Adela. I respect her
too much."</p>

<p>Go where he would, do what he might, the face he loved
was ever before his fancy. As the time drew near for her
departure to America a strange longing took possession of
him. He yearned to see the living face of the girl once
more, before the wild waves of the blue Atlantic divided
them forever as widely as if she were in her grave and he
in his. He had no longer any bitterness or anger toward
her in his heart since he had learned of that sweet sorrow
hidden in her young breast&mdash;a sorrow akin to his own.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the man who was so cold and hard
that he could not love her," he said to himself. "He
must be a stock or a stone indeed. Poor little Leonora!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
I will go down to Lancaster and bid her good-bye and god-speed
on her homeward way. There can be no harm in
that. I must see her once more, or I shall go mad with
longing for her sweet, fair face and her soft voice."</p>

<p>So in the first heat of sweltering July he went down to
Lancaster Park, intent on sating his restless pain with one
last look at the beloved face.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>He thought himself very fortunate that when he crossed
the grounds of Lancaster and entered the house, no one
saw him. It was just what he wished.</p>

<p>He went straight to the housekeeper's room, and he
found Mrs. West sitting alone in the little sitting-room,
going over her account-book with a pen and ink. She rose
in some perturbation at the unexpected sight of the master
of Lancaster Park.</p>

<p>"I did not know you were in the house, my lord," she
said.</p>

<p>"I have just entered it," he replied. "Do not let me
disturb you, Mrs. West. I came to see your niece."</p>

<p>"Leonora?" she said, with some surprise. "Oh, dear!
I am very sorry, but she is not here;" and she wondered at
the sudden paleness that overspread his face.</p>

<p>"Not here?" he stammered. "Is she gone, then? I
thought&mdash;I understood that you would go with her to
America."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, so I shall," she answered; "but she is not
gone there yet. I did not mean that. She will be here this
evening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is she now?" he asked, eagerly, and Mrs. West
replied:</p>

<p>"She has gone over to the Abbey ruins to make a
sketch this morning."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, and hurried out of the room
with such precipitancy that the good soul stared after him
in amazement and consternation.</p>

<p>"Dear me! what has that poor child done now?" she
thought, nervously. "It is a pity she ever came to Lancaster
Park. She has but a sorry time of it here. I
almost wish she had accepted Lieutenant De Vere. It
would have been such a grand match for her, and she is
too bright and pretty to remain in my station of life. I
wonder what Lord Lancaster can want with her. Is he
going to scold her for anything she has done?"</p>

<p>But while she propounded these uneasy questions to herself,
our hero was striding across the park and lanes and
fields toward the Abbey ruins, every other thought swallowed
up in the intense longing to see Leonora again. His
heart beat heavily as he came in sight of her, at last, sitting
among the green graves, as he had seen her before, but
not sketching busily now, for her drawing materials lay
beside her on the grass, and her head was bowed on her
arm, her face hidden from sight on her black sleeve.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" he thought, compassionately, "she
has a sorrow to grieve over as well as I;" and he stepped
softly, almost fearing to intrude upon the sacredness of
her grief, yet loath to turn back again, for something drew
him irresistibly to her side.</p>

<p>The soft echo of his footstep in the grass startled her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
She looked up quickly with a low cry. He saw tears upon
her face, and her rosy lips were quivering like a child's.</p>

<p>"Leonora!" he cried, and knelt down impulsively by
her side.</p>

<p>She was so taken by surprise for a moment that she forgot
to draw away the hands he caught daringly in his.
She looked up at him, and said, with a catch in her
breath:</p>

<p>"I thought you were in London."</p>

<p>"So I was until to-day; but I came down to bid you
good-bye," he answered, feasting his hungry sight unrestrainedly
on the pale beauty of her lifted face.</p>

<p>"Then you knew that I was going away?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw De Vere in town. He told me," he
answered; and a pretty blush crept into her cheeks, and
her lashes fell. "And so," he went on, half smiling,
"you refused my friend, in spite of all my advice to the
contrary?"</p>

<p>She pulled her hands suddenly away.</p>

<p>"Yes, I refused him. Was it worth my while," with a
stinging scorn her voice, "to sell my body and soul for
paltry gold?"</p>

<p>"No; you were right not to give the hand while your
heart was another's," he said, bending down to look into
her face that suddenly grew burning crimson as she cried
out, sharply:</p>

<p>"Why do you say that? How dare you? Has Lieutenant
De Vere told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has told me that you would not marry him because
you loved another. He is a thrice better man whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
he may be, Leonora. How much I envy him I need not
say," he said, earnestly, carried away by the passion that
filled him.</p>

<p>She looked at him with her gray-blue eyes full of wonder.</p>

<p>"You! Lady Adela's intended husband!" she said,
bitterly.</p>

<p>"I am not her intended husband," he answered. "Do
you think I am less noble than you, Leonora? that I could
wrong any one by giving my hand without my heart?
No, I do not love Lady Adela, and I can never be her husband.
Do you know what I was doing up in London,
child?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" she answered.</p>

<p>"Well, I was trying to exchange into a regiment that is
<i>en route</i> for India. I am going to throw over the twenty
thousand a year and run away from England and my
pain."</p>

<p>"You are?" she said, drawing a long breath and gazing
at him with dilated, wondering eyes. "But why, Lord
Lancaster?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask me why?" he asked, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes, because I can not understand at all why you are
going to India. What pain is it you are running away
from?"</p>

<p>He started and looked at her keenly. Was it possible
that she did not guess? Had she misunderstood him all
along? His heart beat with a sudden hope.</p>

<p>"I am fleeing from that misery that the poet has put
into immortal doggerel," he said. "Have you never heard
of it, Leonora? That pain which is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Of all pains the greatest pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To love and not be loved again?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She looked at him with a new, strange light in her soft
eyes that made his heart beat tumultuously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard of it," she said; "but I did not
know that you were a victim to its pangs. Who is it that
you love, Lord Lancaster?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible you do not know?" he asked; and then
he saw that her eyes were shining with hope, and her whole
graceful form trembling.</p>

<p>He took the small hands again into his, and she did not
offer to take them away.</p>

<p>"I will make a compact with you, Leonora," he said.
"If I will tell you whom I love, will you then tell me to
whom you have given your heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will tell you," she replied, with a soft, sweet
laugh.</p>

<p>"Listen, then," he said. "I have been in love with
you, Leonora, ever since that first day I saw you in New
York."</p>

<p>"And I with you," she answered, glowing with happy
blushes.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he cried, and caught her in his arms
and pressed her to his beating heart. "Then why have
you been so cruel to me all the time?"</p>

<p>"Because I thought you were going to marry Lady
Adela, and I was so jealous and unhappy that I misunderstood
you all the while," Leonora confessed, with shy
frankness.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p>"Lady Lancaster will be very angry with us, will she
not?" asked Leonora, lifting her head from his breast,
where it had been resting a few silent, happy moments.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt she will," he replied, with supreme
indifference to his aunt's wrath.</p>

<p>"She will not give you any of her money, I suppose?"
pursued the girl.</p>

<p>"No, not a penny, I am sure. But we can do without
it, can we not, love?" he asked, fondly.</p>

<p>"But will you never regret that you chose me instead of
Lady Adela and your aunt's fortune? Can you bear poverty
for my sake?"</p>

<p>"I shall never regret anything, and for the rest I shall
never know that I am poor. Having you, my darling, I
shall always deem myself rich," he answered, fondly
caressing her.</p>

<p>"And you will never be ashamed of me?" anxiously.</p>

<p>"Never, my darling."</p>

<p>"Nor of poor Aunt West, who is only the housekeeper
at Lancaster Park?"</p>

<p>Then indeed he winced, but only for a moment, and he
answered bravely:</p>

<p>"She belongs to you, Leonora, and she is, besides, a
good and worthy woman. I shall not be ashamed of her,
but she must not serve at the Park any more; she shall
be raised to a position befitting the aunt of the future
Lady Lancaster."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"She will leave the Park to-morrow. We are going to
London for a week, then we sail for New York," said Leonora.</p>

<p>"Is my bride going to leave me so soon?" he whispered, fondly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but she will come back when you come to New
York for her," answered Leonora, with a blush and a smile.</p>

<p>"That will be in a very short while, then. But why go
at all, darling? Couldn't we be married right away?"</p>

<p>"Without my trousseau? No, sir, thank you. Besides,
my aunt and I have some business to attend to in New
York, and I want her to see my native land and appreciate
it."</p>

<p>"When may I come after you, then, my darling? In
September?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!"</p>

<p>"October?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed&mdash;that is, I will ask Aunt West," demurely.</p>

<p>"I shall not wait a day longer than October, miss. Do
you hear that?" he says, laughing, but in earnest, for he
says to himself, thoughtfully, "The darling has no one but
Mrs. West to take care of her, and the sooner she is married
and settled, the better for her."</p>

<p>"You begin to play the tyrant soon," laughs the happy
betrothed.</p>

<p>"In revenge for the way you have treated me all this
while," he replies.</p>

<p>And then he adds, with a sterner light in his handsome
blue eyes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to take you home now, Leonora, and present
you to Lady Lancaster as my promised wife. Are you
willing, my darling?"</p>

<p>"I have no objection," she answered, for Leonora, being
but human, thought she would rather enjoy this triumph
over her enemy.</p>

<p>So they went back to the house, and Lancaster led his
love to the library, where one of the servants had told him
Lady Lancaster was sitting with Mrs. West, going over the
housekeeping books of the latter.</p>

<p>They opened the door and entered. My lady stared at
the pair in horror for a moment, then she rose majestically
to her feet and struck her gold-headed cane upon the floor
with a resounding thump.</p>

<p>"So you are come home at last!" she cried. "But
what does this mean? Why have you brought this impertinent
minx into my presence?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will speak more respectfully of Miss West
when I tell you that she is my promised wife, and the
future Lady of Lancaster," her nephew answered sternly.</p>

<p>"The Lady of Lancaster! What! do you mean that
you have sacrificed all your future prospects for this low-born
and penniless girl?" cried my lady, growing purple
in the face and actually foaming at the lips with fury.</p>

<p>"I have sacrificed nothing, and I have secured my
future happiness by my betrothal," Lord Lancaster
answered, proudly.</p>

<p>The old lady stared at him speechless with rage for a
few seconds, then she struck her cane violently upon the
floor again, and burst out with concentrated wrath:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then hear me, you blind, besotted fool! You think
you have played me a fine trick, but I'll have my revenge,
be sure of that! Not a dollar of my money shall ever go
to you! I will leave it all to the next of kin. And you,
Clive Lancaster, may go on earning your beggarly pittance
in the army, and your wife may take in soldiers' washing,
and your children starve or beg, but I will never throw you
a crust to keep you from starving, nor a rag to keep you
from freezing!"</p>

<p>An indignant retort rose to the young man's lips, but
before he could speak Leonora's sweet, clear voice rang
out upon the silence:</p>

<p>"I hope, Lady Lancaster, that neither myself, my husband,
nor my children may be reduced to the dire necessity
you anticipate. I shall persuade Captain Lancaster to
leave the army and live at Lancaster Park. He can well
afford to do so without your money, for I am as rich as
you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, Leonora!" cried her aunt, dismayed.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear aunt," cried the girl, dauntlessly, "I am
not the poor, dependent girl you and every one else thought
me. My father made his fortune in California. He was
very wealthy, and he left me his whole fortune, with
the exception of a legacy to yourself that will keep you in
luxury all your life."</p>

<p>"But why did you let us think that you were poor, my
dear?" exclaimed the good soul.</p>

<p>Leonora laughed gayly, in spite of her enemy's angry,
wondering face.</p>

<p>"I did not exactly let you," she said. "You see, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
all took it for granted, and I did not contradict it, for,"
with a shy glance into her lover's face, "I wanted to see if
any one would love me for myself alone, and I am richly
rewarded; for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'He does not love me for my birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor for my lands so broad and fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He loves me for my own true worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And that is well&mdash;'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lady Lancaster could have killed her for her brilliant
triumph, but she was powerless to do anything but carry
out her angry threats, so she retired from the scene and
went to her dower house, where she actually adopted a
scion of the house of Lancaster and made him the heir to
her wealth; but this lad was too young to marry the earl's
daughter, so the dowager never had that honor in the
family.</p>

<p>But her spleen and venom passed harmlessly and unheeded
over the heads of Lord Lancaster and his fair Leonora,
for, in the far-famed language of the story-book,
"they were married, and live happily ever afterward."</p>

<p>This is the most remarkable book
which has appeared during the present
generation. It gives the absolutely
true history of that arch
criminal, the burglar and murderer,
Charles Peace, who for many years
masqueraded in England under many
different personalities, but always as that of a respectable
gentleman. He was without doubt the most depraved monster
who ever preyed upon society. He was bad-mad or mad-bad
and from other points of view when Justice finally caught
and executed him upon the scaffold the world was well rid
of him.</p>

<p>He started his career when he was eleven years old and
during the different periods when he was outside of prison,
masquerading always as a respectable business man, he
changed his personality when the darkness of night fell and
carried out the boldest robberies and the most daring criminal
schemes ever perpetrated by any one man in the history of
the world.</p>

<p>No other criminal who ever lived could compare in cunning
and daring with Charles Peace, the Master Criminal. Read
